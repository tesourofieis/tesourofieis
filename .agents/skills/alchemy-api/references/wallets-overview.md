# Wallets

## Summary
High-level integration notes for Alchemy **Wallet APIs** (the product formerly branded as "Smart Wallets") and the smart-account tooling around them. This section is intentionally light: enough to integrate without diving into deep wallet infrastructure.

## Debugging
- The Transaction Lifecycle Dashboard integrates with **Tenderly** for debugging failed Wallet API transactions (PAYG/Enterprise tiers).
- **Debug** button: opens Tenderly debugger for onchain reverts (transactions with a hash).
- **Simulate** button: runs Tenderly simulation for offchain failures (`UserOperationExecutionError`, no tx hash).
- Use when diagnosing opaque reverts, `AA23` errors, or batched call failures.
