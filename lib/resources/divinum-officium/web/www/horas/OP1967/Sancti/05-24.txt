Transfer of Our Holy Father, Dominic; Third Class

[Invit] 
The glad solemnities of Dominic are begun. * Let the church appluad with abundant praise, alleluia. 

[Hymnus Matutinum]
Applaud the Lord's own champion new,
Praise Dominic, sing loud his fame.
His work, the Lord's, his preaching, true,
His life befits his Master's name. 
_
Virginity, in highest fame,
All lily-white he kept unstained;
His zeal burned like a torch aflame,
For souls that Satan else had gained.
_
The world he trod beneath his feet,
And on to rugged toil he pressed;
Unarmed he runs the foe to meet,
By Christ's strong grace unheld and blessed.
_
He sends his brethren through the sphere,
His weapons are the gospel true,
Unceasing prayer and frequent tear,
While miracles his path bestrew.
_
May God the Three and One be praised;
In glory, honour, might and love;
And we to heavenly joy be raised
At Dominic's prayer for us above.
Amen.

[Lectio1]
From the Book of Ecclesiasticus
The prophet Eli'jah arose like a fire, and his word burned like a torch.~
He brought a famine upon them, and by his zeal he made them few in number.~
By the word of the Lord he shut up the heavens, and also three times brought down fire.~
How glorious you were, O Eli'jah, in your wonderous deeds! And who has the right to boast which you have?~
You have raised a corpse from death and from Hades, by the word of the Most High.~

R. O happy vine, from whose shoot so great a growth spreads over the world, * giving mankind to~
to drink of wine of heaven from the life-giving cupm alleluia. 
V. With an abundance of branches it already encircles the world. - Giving. 

It was you who brought kings down to destruction, and famous men from their beds; who heard~
rebuke at Sinai and judgements of vengeance at Horeb; who anointed kings to inflict retribution,~
and prophets to succeed you. You who were taken up by a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot with horses~
of fire; you who are ready at the appointed time, it is written, to calm the wrath of God before it~
breaks out in fury, to turn the heart of the father to the son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.~
Blessed are those who saw you, and those who have been adorned in love; for we also shall surely live.~
It was Eli'jah who was covered by the whirlwind, and Eli'sha was filled with his spirit; in all his days~
he did not tremble before any ruler, and no one brought him into subjection. Nothing was too hard~
for him, and when he was dead his body prophesied. As in his life he did wonders, so in death his~
deeds were marvellous. 

R. Choirs of angels meet him as he goes up from the valley of this uncertain world. * O good Jesus,~
at the prayer of Dominic, grant that we may be pleasing to you, alleluia.
V. On account of him, through whom you raised many from the dead, remit to us the punishment~
we have incurred. - O good Jesus.
