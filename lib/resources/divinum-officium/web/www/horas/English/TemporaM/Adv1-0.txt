[Lectio4]
Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrha. To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims, saith the Lord? I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck goats.

[Lectio8]
And, although this is difficult to maintain in this life, yet the attempt can frequently be renewed, in order that we may the oftener and longer be occupied with spiritual rather than fleshly cares; and by our spending ever greater portions of our time on higher cares, even our temporal actions may end in gaining the incorruptible riches.

[Responsory11]
R. Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch; and a King shall reign in wisdom and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth:
* And this is His name whereby He shall be called: The Lord our Righteous one.
V. In His days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely.
R. And this is His name whereby He shall be called: The Lord our Righteous one.

[Lectio12]
There has not yet arisen any new disturbance of the sea and of the waves. But since many prophecies have already been fulfulled, there is no doubt that the few which remain will also follow, for the accomplishment of that which has gone before is our certitude of that which is to follow. For this reason, dearest brethren, that your minds may be alert and zealous for your safety, lest, feeling secure, they remain inactive, and on account of ignorance they become weak. But in all things let fear, on the one hand, rouse them up, and on the other hand, let solicitude for doing good strengthen them.
