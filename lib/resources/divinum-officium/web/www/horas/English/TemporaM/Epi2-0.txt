!2 Cor 1:12-14
12 For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conversed in this world: and more abundantly towards you.  
13 For we write no other things to you than what you have read and known. And I hope that you shall know unto the end:
14 As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory, as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

* Protect me under the shadow of thy wings.
V. Shew forth thy wonderful mercies; thou who savest them that trust in thee.
