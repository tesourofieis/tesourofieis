From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 25:1-13.
At that time Jesus spoke to his disciples this parable: "Then will the kingdom of heaven be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and the bride." And so forth.
_
Homily by St. Hilary, Bishop (of Poitiers.)
!Comment, on Matth.
Our Lord and God in the body is the bridegroom and the bride. For as the spirit is the bridegroom of the flesh, so the flesh is the bride of the spirit. At length at the sounding of the trumpet the virgins went forth to meet the bridegroom alone; for now now the two were one, because the lowliness of the body had been drawn beyond itself into spiritual glory. By our first progress, by the duties of this life, we are prepared to hasten to the resurrection from the dead. The lamps are the light of shining souls, made brilliant by the Sacrament of Baptism. The oil is the fruit of good works. The vessels are the human bodies, in the interior of which the treasure of a good conscience lies hidden. The sellers are those who are in need of the mercy of the faithful, yet of themselves give ample return for the help which they seek, namely, the relief of their necessity, by selling, as it were, their knowledge of our good works. For these are the plentiful fuel for the unfailing light which must be purchased with the fruits of mercy and stored up.

[Responsory9]
R. Saint Benedict, three days after, standing in his cell, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, beheld the soul of his sister (which was departed from her body),
* In the likeness of a dove to ascend into heaven.
V. Who rejoicing much to see her great glory, with hymns and lauds gave thanks to almighty God, and did impart the news of this her death to his monks.
R. In the likeness of a dove to ascend into heaven.

[Lectio10]
The wedding itself is the assumption of immortality and the union in a new state between corruption and incorruption. The delay of the bridegroom is the repose of those who believe; and in the time of penance this sleep is the temporary death of all. The cry in the middle of the night, when all are unaware, is the voice of the trumpet preceding the coming of the Lord and rousing all to go forth to meet the bridegroorn. The taking up of the lamps signifies the return of the soul into the bodies, and the light of the lamps, which is contained in the vessels of the bodies, is the consciousness of good works shining forth.

[Responsory10]
R. Scholastica’s soul was seen in the form of a dove and the brother’s glad heart sang hymns and praises beyond measure:
* Blessed be such a departure and still more blessed such an entrance!
V. Father Benedict was filled with heavenly joy.
R. Blessed be such a departure and still more blessed such an entrance!

[Lectio11]
Those who, while in the body, have taken advantage of the opportune time for working and have prepared to go forth immediately at the coming of the bridegroom are the prudent virgins. The foolish ones are they who, careless and negligent, cared only for the things of the present, and, unmindful of the Lord’s promises, have not concerned themselves with any hope of the resurrection. And now, because they could not go out to meet the bridegroom with unlighted lamps, they besought those who were prudent to lend them oil. But these answered that they could not give any, lest perhaps there would not be enough for all. By this is signified that no one can be helped by the works and merits of others, since it is necessary that each one buy oil for his own lamp. The wise exhorted the foolish to return and buy oil, in order that, although late in observing the precepts of God, they might, with lamps lighted, perhaps be made worthy for the coming of the bridegroom.

[Responsory11]
R. Scholastica’s soul went forth like a dove from the ark of her body bearing an olive branch the sign of peace and grace.
* She took her flight to heaven.
V. She found not whereon to rest her feet. 
R. She took her flight to heaven.

[Lectio12]
Whilst the foolish were thus delayed, the bridegroom came; and the wise ones, who were encircled by the carefully prepared light of their lamps, entered with him to the wedding at feast; that is, they once entered into heavenly glory at the coming of the majesty of the Lord. And because there is now no time for penance, the foolish hasten and ask that the door be opened to them. To whom the bridegroom makes answer that he does not know them. These were not at the ceremony of the Lord's coming, neither had they hastened at the sound of the trumpet warning them, neither had they joined the company of those entering with the bridegroom, but, by delaying, had wasted their time and so were unworthy of entering into the wedding feast.

[Responsory12]
R. You who in the appearance of a dove learnt today the mystery of how to ascend to heaven
* Help us to live so innocently that we may be able to live what you have loved.
V. You who in your childish years was covered with the sacred veil, and knew the mysteries of heaven.
R. Help us to live so innocently that we may be able to live what you have loved.
