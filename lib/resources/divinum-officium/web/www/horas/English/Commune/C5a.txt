When His holy one called, * the Lord heard him; yea, the Lord heard him, and gave him peace.;;4
Let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice, Lord, for Thou hast blessed the righteous; * thou hast compassed him with thy favour as with a shield;;5
O Lord, our Ruler, * how excellent is thy Name in all the earth! Who hast crowned thine holy one with glory and honour, and madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;;8

And here we may also understand by the ten pounds the ten words, that is, the~
Commandments, and by the five pounds, the enforcement of their teaching. But I~
would that a lawyer should be in all things perfect. For the kingdom of God is~
not in word but in power. (1 Cor. iv. 20.) Meet also is it, that, in speaking of~
Jews, Christ should represent only two as bringing in increased capital, for~
these talents are talents not of money but of grace, and to increase money by~
usury is a very different thing from improving heavenly revelation by the like~
means.

From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 16:24-27
At that time, Jesus said unto His disciples: If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. And so on.
_
Homily by Pope St. Gregory (the Great.)
!32nd on the Gospels
Our Lord and Redeemer came into the world a new Man, and gave the world new~
commandments. For against the ways of our old life, brought and bred up in sin,~
He set the contrast of His new life. It was the old way, according to the~
knowledge of the carnal man, for every man to keep his own goods, and, if he~
were able to do it, to take his neighbour's goods also, and, if he were not able~
to take them, at least to lust after them. But the Heavenly Physician hath~
medicines wherewith to meet all the diseases of sin. For, even, as by the art of~
the physician, things hot are healed by things cold, and things cold by things~
hot, so doth our Lord set against sin holiness, ordaining for the lecherous~
purity, for the miserly munificence, for the hot-tempered meekness, and for the~
proud lowliness.

So the Lord, when He would give a new commandment unto them that came to Him,~
said Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be~
My disciple, (Luke xiv. 33,) as though He had said openly: All ye that according~
to the old man lust after your neighbour's goods, must, according to the zeal of~
the new man, give away even that which is your own. But let us hear again what~
He saith in this place If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself.~
First He saith that we must deny to ourselves that which is our own, and now~
that we must even deny ourselves to ourselves. Perchance it is not hard for a~
man to give up that which is his own, but it is exceeding hard to give up~
himself. To deny himself his possessions is little but to deny himself himself~
is a denial exceeding great.

[Lectio9 in 4 loco]
Let when we come unto Him the Lord will have us deny to ourselves even ourselves,~
since as many of us as are entered into the battle of faith, are entered into a~
contention against evil spirits. But the evil spirits have nothing of their own~
in this world, and therefore must we wrestle with them, naked with naked. For if~
he that is clothed, wrestle with him that is naked, he faileth swiftly, because~
he hath whereon he that is naked taketh hold. And what are all things earthly~
but things wherewith the soul is clothed upon? whosoever therefore will wrestle~
with Satan, let him cast away his clothes, lest he be thereby endangered.
