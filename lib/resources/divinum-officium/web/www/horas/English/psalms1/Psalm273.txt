(Canticum Sapientiæ * Sap 16:20-21, 26, 29; 17:1)
16:20 You did feed your people with the food of angels, and gave them bread from heaven prepared without labour,
16:20 Having in it all that is delicious, and the sweetness of every taste.
16:21 For your sustenance shewed your sweetness to your children:
16:21 And serving every man’s will, it was turned to what every man liked.
16:26 That your children, O Lord, whom you loved, might know that it is not the growing of fruits that nourishes men, but your word preserves them that believe in you.
16:29 For the hope of the unthankful shall melt away as the winter’s ice, and shall run off as unprofitable water.
17:1 For your judgments, O Lord, are great, and your words cannot be expressed: therefore undisciplined souls have erred.
