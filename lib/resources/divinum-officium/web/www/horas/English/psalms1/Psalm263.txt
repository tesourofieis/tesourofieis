(Canticum Isaiae * Isa 9:2-7)
9:2 The people that walked in darkness, * have seen a great light:
9:2 To them that dwelt in the region of the shadow of death, * light is risen.
9:3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, * and hast not increased the joy.
9:3 They shall rejoice before thee, as they that rejoice in the harvest, * as conquerors rejoice after taking a prey, when they divide the spoils.
9:4 For the yoke of their burden, and the rod of their shoulder, * and the sceptre of their oppressor thou best overcome, as in the day of Median.
9:5 For every violent taking of spoils, with tumult, * and garment mingled with blood, shall be burnt, and be fuel for the fire.
9:6 For a child is born to us, * and a son is given to us,
9:6 And the government is upon his shoulder: * and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor,
9:6 God the Mighty, the Father of the world to come, * the Prince of Peace.
9:7 His empire shall be multiplied, * and there shall be no end of peace:
9:7 He shall sit upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom; * to establish it and strengthen it with judgment and with justice.
9:7 From henceforth and for ever: * The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.
