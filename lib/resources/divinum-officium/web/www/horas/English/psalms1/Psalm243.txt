(Canticum Isaiae * Isa 63:1-5)
63:1 Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bosra,
63:1 This beautiful one in his robe, walking in the greatness of his strength.
63:1 I, that speak justice, and am a defender to save.
63:2 Why then is thy apparel red, and thy garments like theirs that tread in the winepress?
63:3 I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the Gentiles there is not a man with me:
63:3 I have trampled on them in my indignation, and have trodden them down in my wrath,
63:3 And their blood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my apparel.
63:4 For the day of vengeance is in my heart, the year of my redemption is come.
63:5 I looked about, and there was none to help: I sought, and there was none to give aid:
63:5 And my own arm hath saved for me, and my indignation itself hath helped me.
