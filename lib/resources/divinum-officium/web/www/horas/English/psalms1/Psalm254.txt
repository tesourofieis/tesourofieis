(Canticum Sapientiae * Sap 3:7-9)
3:7 The just shall shine, * and shall run to and fro like sparks among the reeds.
3:8 They shall judge nations, and rule over people, * and their Lord shall reign forever.
3:9 They that trust in him, shall understand the truth: * and they that are faithful in love shall rest in him:
3:9 For grace * and peace is to his elect.
