[Ant 2]
Art thou only a stranger to Jerusalem * and hast not heard about Jesus, how they gave him to condemnation to death? Alleluia.

[Ant 3]
And other sheep I have, * that are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd, alleluia.
