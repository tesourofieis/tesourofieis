Continuation of the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 7:14-31
In that time about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. And the Jews wondered. And so on.
_
Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!29th Tract on John.
He Who had gone up unto the Feast, not openly, but as it were in secret, the Same taught, and spake openly, and no man laid hands upon Him. That He had hid Himself, was for example's sake; that He manifested Himself, was to show His~
power. And when He taught, the Jews marvelled. As seemeth to my I mind, they all marvelled, but were not all converted. And wherefore marvelled they? Because many of them knew where He was born, and how He had been brought up. They had never seen Him learn letters; but they heard Him dispute concerning the law, and alledge the testimony of the same, as no man could do who had not read it; and no man can read unless he learn; and therefore they marvelled. But their marvelling was unto the Teacher an occasion for the revealing of higher truth.

[Lectio2]
For when they marvelled and whispered, the Lord said a certain deep thing, yea, a thing worthy of very careful thought and discussion. And what was this thing which the Lord gave for an answer to such as marvelled that He knew letters, having never learned? Jesus answered them and said My doctrine is not Mine, but His That sent Me. Here is the first depth, for He seemeth in these few words to enunciate a contradiction. He saith not This doctrine is not Mine but My doctrine is not Mine. If it be not thine, O thine? If it be thine, wherefore sayest Thou that it is not thine? For Thou sayest My doctrine is not Mine.
