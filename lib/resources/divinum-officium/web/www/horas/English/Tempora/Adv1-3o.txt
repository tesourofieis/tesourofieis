12 As for my people, their oppressors have stripped them, and women have ruled over them. O my people, they that call thee blessed, the same deceive thee, and destroy the way of thy steps.
13 The Lord standeth up to judge, and he standeth to judge the people.
14 The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and its princes: for you have devoured the vineyard, and the spoil of the poor is in your house.
15 Why do you consume my people, and grind the faces of the poor?  saith the Lord the God of hosts.
