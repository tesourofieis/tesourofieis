!Commemoration for St. Blaise.
This Blaise was chosen Bishop of the city of Sebaste in Armenia, in which place~
he enjoyed a great reputation for virtue. When Diocletian began to make the~
Christians the objects of his insatiable cruelty, the Saint hid himself in a~
cave on Mount Argaeus, where he lay till he was found by some of the soldiers of~
Agricolaus the governor, who were out hunting. He was brought before the~
governor, who commanded him to be thrown into irons. While he was in prison,~
Blaise healed many of the sick, who were brought to him on account of his~
reputation of saintliness, and among others a boy who had been despaired of by~
the physicians, and who was at the point of death, from a fish bone which had become~
fixed in his throat. Blaise appeared twice before the governor, but neither~
cajolements nor threats could induce him to sacrifice to the gods. He was first~
beaten with rods, and afterwards put on the rack, where his flesh was mangled~
with iron combs. At last his head was cut off, whereby he finished a noble~
testimony to the faith which is in Christ our Lord. He bore witness on the 3rd~
day of February, (in the year of salvation 316).
