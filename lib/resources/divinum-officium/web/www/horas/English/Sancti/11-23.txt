[Lectio4]
Clement, the son of Faustinus, was a Roman, from the quarter of the Coelian~
Mount. He was a disciple of the blessed Peter, and is the same concerning whom~
Paul saith, writing to the Philippians And I entreat thee also, true yokefellow,~
help those women which laboured with me in the Gospel, with Clement also, and~
with other my fellow-labourers, whose names are written in the book of life.~
~(iv. 3.) (He succeeded Cletus as Bishop of Rome.) He it was who divided the~
seven quarters of the city among seven scribes, one to each, whose duty it was~
to search out most carefully, and record in writing the sufferings and acts of~
the Martyrs. He himself also wrote much, and that most orthodox and healthy,~
whereby he clearly explained the Christian Religion.

[Lectio5]
His teaching and the holiness of his life brought many to believe in Christ, and~
he was therefore exiled by the Emperor Trajan to Kherson, in the Crimea, where~
he found two thousand Christians, who had been condemned by the same Trajan.~
There they all worked in the marble quarries. During their labour they suffered~
for want of water, and Clement prayed, and then went up an hill hard by, on the~
top whereof he saw a Lamb standing, touching with its right foot a flowing~
spring of sweet waters. Therewith they all quenched their thirst, and by this~
miracle many unbelievers were brought to believe in Christ, and began to honour~
the holiness of Clement.

[Lectio6]
These things moved Trajan to send a messenger to the Crimea, who tied an anchor~
about Clement's neck, and cast him into the deep of the sea. After it had been~
done, while the Christians were praying on the shore, the sea went back three~
miles, and when they followed it, they found a grotto of marble, in form like a~
temple, and therein a stone coffin wherein was laid the body of the Martyr, and,~
hard by, the anchor wherewith he had been sunk. Then were the country people~
moved to receive the faith of Christ. The body of Clement was afterwards brought~
to Rome, in the time of Pope Nicholas I, and buried in his own Church. A Church~
was also built in the Crimea, in the place where God had made the water to break~
forth. Clement lived as Pope nine years, six months, and six days. He held two~
Ordinations in the month of December, wherein he made ten Priests, two Deacons,~
and fifteen Bishops for diverse places.

The Lesson is taken from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew (xxiv, 42)
At that time, Jesus said unto His disciples: Watch, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. And so on.
_
Homily by St. Hilary, Bishop (of Poitiers)
!Comment. on Matth. chap. 26
To the end that we may know that our ignorance of that day whereof no man knoweth is not without use, the Lord moveth us to watch for the coming of the thief, to be ever instant in prayer, and ever busy in such works as He commandeth. He showeth how that the devil is that thief who watcheth ever how he may spoil our goods, breaking into the house of our body; that, while we are dwelling therein careless and heavy with sleep, he may dig through our walls with the arms of his craft and temptations. Us, therefore, it behoveth to be ready, who have ever our ignorance concerning that day to be unto us a reason of watchfulness.

[Lectio8](rubrica tridentina)
!Chap. 27
"Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over His household?" Although the Lord doth move us all in common to weary not in carefulness and watching, He layeth more especially upon the rulers of His people, that is, the Bishops, this duty, to look always for His coming. For such an one is that faithful and wise servant, made ruler over his Lord's household, who ever seeketh such things as be convenient and useful for the people unto him committed. Such an one, if he hear this word, and do that which he is commanded, that is, if he strengthen by seasonable and sound doctrine such things as be weak, if he bind together that which is sundered, if he make straight again what is become crooked, and give to the household the lively Word which is able to feed them unto life eternal, if such an one do thus, and meanwhile the hour which he knoweth not come upon him, he shall obtain glory of the Lord, as a faithful steward and an useful overseer: that is, he shall have glory with God, for in all things he shall have of that which is best.

[Lectio93]
!Commemoration for the Holy Martyr Felicity.
The Lesson is taken from the Sermons of Pope St. Gregory (the Great.)
!3rd Horn, on the Gospels.
That blessed woman Felicity, whose Birth-feast we are keeping today, had as~
much dread of leaving her seven sons living after her in the flesh, as have~
carnal-minded mothers of seeing them go dead before them. When she was taken in~
the strong pains of persecution, she braced up the hearts of her children by~
bidding them cleave to the Fatherland above, and became their mother for the~
spiritual, as she had aforetime been for the fleshly life, bringing them forth~
for God by her exhortation, as she had brought them forth for the world by her~
body. And shall I not call this woman a Martyr? Nay, more than Martyr. The seven~
whom she trusted to God were seven children sent before her to death. She~
suffered first and triumphed last.

[Ant 2]
As he began to move toward the sea * the people cried out with a loud voice: O~
Lord Jesus Christ, deliver him! And Clement wept, and said: Father, receive my~
spirit!

[Lectio94]
Clement, a Roman and disciple of blessed Peter, assigned each of the seven~
districts of the City to a notary who was to investigate carefully the~
sufferings of the Martyrs and their deeds and to write them down. He himself~
wrote a great deal to explain the Christian religion rightly for the salvation~
of others. Because he was converting many to the faith of Christ by his teaching,~
and the holiness of his life, he was exiled by the emperor Trajan to the~
wilderness near the city of Cherson across the Black Sea. There, he found two~
thousand Christians who had been similarly condemned by the emperor. When he had~
converted many nonbelievers in that region to the faith of Christ, at the~
command of the same emperor he was cast into the sea with an anchor tied to his~
neck, and won the crown of martyrdom. His body was later brought to Rome by Pope~
Nicholas I and honorably buried in the Church which had already been dedicated~
to him.

[Ant 3]
Lord, * Thou hast given unto thy Martyr Clement a tabernacle in the sea, after~
the fashion of a temple of marble, builded by the hands of Angels. And Thou~
givest a way thither unto the people on the land, that they may tell of thy~
marvellous works.
