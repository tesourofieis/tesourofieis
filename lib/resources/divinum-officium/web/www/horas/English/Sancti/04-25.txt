[Oratio]
O God, Who didst exalt thy blessed Evangelist Mark, by giving him grace to~
preach thine Evangel, grant unto us, we beseech thee, ever to follow more and~
more what he teacheth, and ever to be shielded from all evil by his prayers.
$Per Dominum

[Lectio4]
From the Book upon Church Writers, composed by St. Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.
_
Mark was the disciple and interpreter of Peter, and it was from what he had~
heard Peter tell, that, at the request of the brethren at Rome, he wrote the~
shortest of the Gospels. When Peter had heard it, he approved it, and gave it to~
the Church to be read, by his authority. Mark betook himself to Egypt, with the~
Gospel which he had compiled, and was the first man who preached Christ at~
Alexandria. There he founded a Church with such teaching and austerity of life,~
that all who followed Christ were constrained to imitate him.

[Lectio5]
Last of all, Philo, that most learned Jew, observing that the first Church of~
Alexandria still kept the law of Moses, wrote a book concerning their manners,~
as if in praise of his own nation, wherein he saith that under the teaching of~
Mark, the Christians of Alexandria had all things in common, just as Luke~
telleth us was the case with all them that believed at Jerusalem. Mark died in~
the eighth year of Nero, and was buried at Alexandria. Anianus succeeded him.
