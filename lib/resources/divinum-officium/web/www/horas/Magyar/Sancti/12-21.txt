Evangélium szent János könyvéből
!John 20:24-29
Azon időben a tizenkettő közül az egyik, Tamás, vagy melléknevén Didimusz, nem volt velük, amikor megjelent nekik Jézus. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!26th on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, what is it in this passage which particularly claimeth~
our attention? Think ye that it was by accident that this chosen Apostle was not~
with them when Jesus came? or, when he came, heard? or, when he heard, doubted?~
or, when he doubted, felt? or when he had felt, believed? All these things were~
not accidental, but Providential. It was a wonderful provision of Divine mercy,~
that this incredulous disciple, by thrusting his fingers into the bodily Wounds~
of his Master, should apply a remedy to the spiritual wounds of unbelief in our~
souls. The doubts of Thomas have done us more good than the faith of all the~
disciples that believed. While he feeleth his way to faith, our minds are freed~
from doubt, and settled in faith.
