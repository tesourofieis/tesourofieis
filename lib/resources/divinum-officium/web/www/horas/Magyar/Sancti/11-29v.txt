Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 1:35-51
Abban az időben ott állt János két tanítványával, s mihelyt meglátta Jézust,~
amint közeledett, így szólt: Nézzétek, az Isten Báránya! És így tovább.

!7th Tract on John
Since John was the friend of the Bridegroom, (iii. 29,) he sought not his own~
glory, but bare witness to the truth. Would he that his disciples should remain~
with him rather than that they should follow the Lord? Nay, he showed his~
disciples Whom they should follow. They thought that he himself was the Lamb;~
but he saith Why wait ye on me? I am not the Lamb. Behold the Lamb of God! '*'~
This was He of Whom he had already said above (29) Behold the Lamb of God! And~
what use to us is the Lamb of God? Behold the Lamb of God, saith John, Which~
taketh away the sin of the world. And the two disciples heard him speak, and~
they followed Jesus.
