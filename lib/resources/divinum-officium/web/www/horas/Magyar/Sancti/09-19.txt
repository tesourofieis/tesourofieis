Evangélium Szt Máté Apostol könyvéből;
!Matt 24:3-13
Azon időben amikor Jézus az Olajfák-hegyén leült, egyedül tanítványai járultak~
hozzá, és kérdezték: "Mondd meg nekünk, mikor következik ez be? És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Hilary, Bishop (of Poitiers.) 
!Comm. on Matth. xxv.
His disciples came unto Him privately, saying Tell us, when shall these things be~
and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world " Here~
are in one question three several points, and the answers are to be understood~
of three several times, and by three several interpretations. " When shall these~
things be " And herein He taught them concerning the fall of the city (of~
Jerusalem), whereof He made plain announcement, lest the unlearned might fall a~
prey to any deceiver. For within the lifetime of His then hearers were to come~
many, saying I am Christ. He giveth warning therefore beforehand, lest such~
pestilential liars should gain any belief.
