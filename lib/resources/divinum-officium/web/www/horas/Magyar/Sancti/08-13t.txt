Evangélium Szt János Apostol könyvéből
!John 12:24-26
Abban az időben így szólt Jézus tanítványaihoz: Bizony, bizony, mondom nektek:~
ha a búzaszem nem hull a földbe, és nem hal el, egymaga marad. És így tovább.
_
Continuation of the Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo. As on Aug. 11.) He~
which suffereth martyrdom hath followed Christ, even to the point of having that~
love, greater than which no man hath, even that a man lay down his life for his~
friends. (John xv. 13.) Hereby also he hath laid down his life for Christ, Who~
hath said touching His members Inasmuch as ye have done it unto these, ye~
have done it unto Me. (Matth. xxv. 35, 40.) Such a servant as this He was~
pleased to make and to call Himself, as He saith: The Son of man came not to be~
ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom for many.~
~(Matth. xx. 28.) A servant of Christ, therefore, is so called for the same~
reason that Christ is called, a servant. And thus it cometh that if any man~
serve Christ, him will the Father honour, even with the great honour that, where~
His Son is, there shall also His servant be and his joy will never wane.
