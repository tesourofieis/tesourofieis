Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 5:1-12
Azon időben a tömeg láttára fölment a hegyre és leült. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Bk. i. on the Lord's Sermon.)
 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. What fools then be they that seek God with their outward eyes, since it is in the heart that He is seen, as it is written elsewhere In simplicity of heart seek Him. (Wisd. i. i.) A simple heart is a pure heart. And even as we cannot see this earthly light, unless the eyes be open, so cannot God be seen, unless that be open which alone can perceive Him. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. The perfection of peace is the absence of contrariety, and the peacemakers are called the children of God because they offer no contrariety against the will of God. As beseemeth children, they have their Father's likeness.
