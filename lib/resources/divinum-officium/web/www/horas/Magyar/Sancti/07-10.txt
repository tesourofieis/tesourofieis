Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 12:46-50
Azon időben amíg Jézus beszélt a néphez, megálltak kint anyja és rokonai, s~
beszélni akartak vele. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory the Great.
!3rd on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren The gospel which is read this day is but very short,~
but it is heavy with great mysteries. Here Jesus, our Maker and Redeemer,~
feigneth Himself as though He knew not His Own Mother, and telleth who they be~
who are His mother and brethren, not by fleshly kinship, but by kinship of mind.~
Who is My Mother And who are My brethren Whosoever shall do the will of My~
Father, Which is in heaven, the same is My brother, and sister, and mother. By~
the which words, what are we to understand, save that He gathereth together from~
out of Heathendom many that are willing to obey His commandments, and that He~
knoweth not Jewry, whereof, according to the flesh, He is a son.
