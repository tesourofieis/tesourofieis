Homily by St John Chrysostom, Patriarch (of Constantinople.)
!72nd on Matthew.
When the Pharisees had heard that Christ had put the Sadducees to silence, they~
gathered themselves together for a fresh attack just when it behoved them to~
be quiet, they willed to contend and so they put forward one of themselves who~
professed skill in the law, not wishing to learn, but to lay a snare. This~
person therefore proposed the question: "Which is the great commandment in the~
law " The first and great commandment is " Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,"~
but they expected that He would make some exception or addition to this in His~
Own case, since He made Himself God. (John x. 33.) With this expectation they~
asked Him the question but what said Christ To show that they had adopted~
this course, because they were loveless, and sick with envy, He answered "Thou~
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with~
all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like~
unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
