Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 17:1-11
Azon időben Jézus az égre emelte tekintetét, és így imádkozott: "Atyám, elérkezett az óra. Dicsőítsd meg Fiadat És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!104th Tract on John.
Our Lord, the Only-begotten and coeternal Son of the Father, was able, if need were, in and from the form of a servant, to pray in silence but He thus~
manifested Himself in prayer, remembering that He is our Teacher. Thus He made known unto us the prayer which He made for us since He was so great a Master that, not only His discourse to them, but His prayer to the Father for them, is an up-building to His disciples. And if it was so for them who were there to hear, truly it is so for us also for whose instruction it hath been written down.
