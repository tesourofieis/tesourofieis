Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 18:15-22
Azon időben mondá Jézus tanítványainak: Ha testvéred megbántott, menj, és figyelmeztesd négyszemközt. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!16th Sermon on the Words of the Lord, vol. x.
Why tell him his fault? Because he hath made thee smart by trespassing against thee? God forbid. If thou tell him his fault because thou lovest thyself, thou dost nothing. But if thou tell it him because thou lovest him, then dost thou do exceeding well. Hear now, in the words of the Gospel itself, for love of whom, thou oughtest to do it, of thyself, or of him. The Lord saith If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. Therefore it behoveth thee to do it for his sake, that thou mayest gain him; since, if thou so do, haply thou mayest gain him; whereas, if thou do it not, he may haply perish. Why then are there so many who reckon lightly of a trespass against their brother, and say I have done no great offence, for I have trespassed only against my fellow man? Deem it not light; thou hast trespassed, though it be against thy fellow man.
