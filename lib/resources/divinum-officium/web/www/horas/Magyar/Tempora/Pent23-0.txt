!Matt 9:18-26
At that time While Jesus spake these things unto the multitudes, behold, there~
came a certain ruler, and worshipped Him, saying Lord, my daughter is even now~
dead. And so on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. i. Comment, on Matth. ix.
The eighth miracle took place upon the occasion when a certain ruler, desiring~
not to be kept out of the mystery of the true circumcision, besought Christ to~
recall his daughter to life. But a woman, which was diseased with an issue of~
blood, thrust herself in, and her cure occupieth the eighth place, so that the~
resurrection of the ruler's daughter is postponed and made the ninth in~
enumeration even as it is written in the Psalms "Ethiopia shall soon stretch~
forth her hands unto God." (lxvii. 32.) And again " Blindness in part is~
happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles is come in and so all~
Israel shall be saved." (Rom. xi. 25, 26.)
