Evangélium szent Máté könyvéből
!Matt 21:10-17.
Azon időben amikor Jézus beért Jeruzsálembe, az egész város izgalomba jött.  És így tovább.
_
Homily by the Venerable Bede, Priest (at Jarrow.)
!11th for Lent, Tom. vii.
The same thing which the Lord showed in a figure by cursing the barren fig-tree,~
He afterwards more plainly put before us by casting the desecrators out of the~
temple. The tree herself had not sinned by bearing no fruit when the Lord was~
hungry, for the time of figs was not yet come, but those Priests had sinned who~
were carrying on worldly business in the Lord's house, and who neglected to~
bring forth that fruit of godliness which they owed, and which the Lord was~
hungry to find in them. The Lord made the fig-tree to wither away under His~
curse, that all men who saw it, and all men who hear of it, might know that they~
will be condemned by the judgment of God, if they content themselves with the~
talk of godliness, without the solid fruit of good works, even as that barren~
figtree was clothed only with a rustling garb of green leaves.
