Evangélium szent Máté könyvéből
!Matt 15:21-28
Azon továbbmenve, Jézus Tírusz és Szidon vidékére vonult vissza. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. ii. Comm. on Matth. xv.
Christ leaveth the Scribes and Pharisees who had spoken falsely against Him, and~
goeth into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, that He may heal the Tyrians and~
Sidonians. But a woman of Canaan cometh to Him out of the land He had left, and~
crieth to Him to give health to her daughter. Remark that the case of the~
daughter of this woman of Canaan is the fifteenth case of healing. Have mercy on~
me, O Lord, Thou Son of David! She knew that He was to be called Son of David~
because she was come out of His own country, and had left the errors of the~
Tyrians and Sidonians when she changed her home and her faith.
