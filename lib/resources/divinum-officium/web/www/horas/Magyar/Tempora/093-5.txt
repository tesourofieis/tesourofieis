Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 7:36-50
Azon időben egy farizeus meghívta Jézust, hogy egyék nála. Betért hát a farizeus~
házába, és asztalhoz telepedett. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!33rd on the Gospels.
Of what is the Pharisee that was exalted by self-righteousness a type, but of~
the Jewish people And of what the woman which was a sinner and came and wept~
at the Lord's feet, but of the conversion of the Gentiles She brought an~
alabaster box of ointment, and stood at His feet behind Him weeping, and began~
to wash His Feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and~
kissed His Feet, and anointed them with the ointment. Of us, therefore, even of~
us, was that woman a type, if after our sins we turn unto the Lord with all our~
heart, and imitate the example of her repentant grief. And of what is the~
ointment a type, but of the sweet savour of a good reputation Whence also Paul~
saith (God maketh manifest the savour of His knowledge by us) in every place~
~(for) we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ. (2 Cor. ii. 15.)
