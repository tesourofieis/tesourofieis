Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 20:11-18
Azon időben Mária ott állt a sír előtt és sírt. Amint így sírdogált, egyszer csak benézett a sírba. Látta, hogy ott, ahol Jézus teste volt, két fehér ruhába öltözött angyal ül És így tovább.

Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!25th on the Gospels.
Mary Magdalene, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, through love of the truth washed away by her tears the befoulment of her sin, and the word of the Truth was fulfilled which He spake : Her sins, which are many, are forgiven : for she loved much. (Luke vii. 47.) She that had remained cold while she sinned, became burning when she loved. For after that she had been to the Sepulchre, and had not found there the Body of the Lord, and had believed that It had been taken away, and had told His disciples, they came and saw, and thought it was even as the woman had said : and it is written Then the disciples went away again unto their own home but Mary stood without at the sepulchre, weeping.
