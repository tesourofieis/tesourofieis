Evangélium szent János könyvéből
!John 2:13-25.
Azon időben a zsidók húsvétjának közeledtével Jézus fölment Jeruzsálembe. A templomban kalmárokat talált, akik ökröt, juhot és galambot árultak És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of H ippo.)
!1 oth Tract on John.
What hear we now, my brethren? Behold, that temple was still but a figure, and~
the Lord drove out therefrom all them that sought their own, even them that were~
come to deal in merchandise. And what was it that they sold there? Only such~
things as were needful to men for the sacrifices that then were. For your love~
knoweth that, because of that people's carnal-mindedness and the stoniness of~
their heart, there were commanded unto them such sacrifices as these, thereby to~
hold them back from idolatry and there, according, they offered up oxen, and~
sheep, and doves. This ye have read, and know.
