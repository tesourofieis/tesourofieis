Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 17:1-9
Azon időben  Jézus maga mellé vette Pétert, Jakabot és testvérét, Jánost, s fölment külön velük egy magas hegyre. Ott elváltozott előttük És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Leo (the Great.)
!On the Transfiguration of the Lord.
Dearly beloved brethren, the Lesson from the Holy Gospel which, entering in by~
our bodily ears, hath knocked at the door of our inner mind, calleth us to~
understand a great mystery. This, by the grace of God, we shall the more readily~
do, if we return to consider what hath been told us just before. The Saviour of~
mankind, even Jesus Christ, laying the foundations of that faith whereby the~
ungodly are called to righteousness and the dead to life, instilled into the~
minds of His disciples, both by the voice of His teaching and the wonder of His~
works, that they should believe Him, the one Christ, to be both the~
Only-begotten Son of God and the Son of man. Had they believed Him one of these~
and not the other, it had availed them nothing to salvation; and the danger was~
equally great, of holding the Lord Jesus Christ to be God without the Manhood,~
or Man only without the Godhead, since we are constrained to acknowledge that He~
is perfect God and perfect Man, and that as there is in the Godhead perfect~
Manhood, so there is in the Manhood perfect Godhead.
