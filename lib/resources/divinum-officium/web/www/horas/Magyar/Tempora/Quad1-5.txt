Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 5:1-15
Azon időben ünnepük volt a zsidóknak, s Jézus fölment Jeruzsálembe És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!17 th Tract on John)
Let us see what is mystically signified by that one infirm man whom alone the~
Lord, keeping to a mysterious unity, chose out of so many sufferers, to be the~
subject of His healing power. He found in him a certain number of years of~
sickness. He had had an infirmity thirty and eight years. How this number is~
proper rather to weakness than to health, will now be the subject of a few~
careful remarks. I bespeak your attention; the Lord will be present, that I may~
speak fitly, and you may understand. The number forty is put before us as~
hallowed, and, in a way, perfect. I think that your love knoweth this God's~
Scriptures often and; often witness it. Ye well know that a Fast of this number~
of days is hallowed. Moses fasted forty days. Elias did the same. And our Lord~
and Saviour Jesus Christ Himself fasted this number of days complete. Moses~
representeth the Law, Elias the Prophets, and the Lord the Gospel. And therefore~
these three appeared on the Mount of the Transfiguration. There the Lord showed~
Himself to His disciples with His Face shining as the sun, and His raiment~
glistering; and He stood between Moses and Elias; as it were, the Gospel~
receiving testimony, on the one hand from the Law, and, on the other, from the~
Prophets.
