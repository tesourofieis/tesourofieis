Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 14:1-11
At that time: As Jesus went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees, to eat~
bread on the Sabbath-day, they watched Him. And, behold, there was a certain man~
before Him, which had the dropsy. And so on.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. vii. on Luke xiv.
Now is healed this man sick of the dropsy, in whom too much watery matter had~
well-nigh drowned the functions of life, and quenched the fire of understanding.~
Anon, a lesson is given in lowly-mindedness, when it is forbidden to the guests~
at a marriage feast to go and sit down unasked in the highest room, albeit the~
Lord spake gently, that the teaching of courtesy might forestall a harsh rebuke,~
reason prevail by dint of persuasion, and the desires be bent to follow the~
instruction. And upon this, as nextdoor neighbour, cometh courtesy, which is so~
called by the Lord, when it is shown to the poor and weak, since to show it to~
them from whom we are to receive aught, is but a movement of self-interest.
