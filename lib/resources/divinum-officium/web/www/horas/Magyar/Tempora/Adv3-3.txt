Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 1:26-38
Azon időben Isten elküldte Gábor angyalt Galilea Názáret nevű városába egy szűzhöz, aki egy Dávid házából való férfinak, Józsefnek volt a jegyese, és Máriának hívták. És így tovább.

Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan,)
!Bk. ii. on Luke.
The mysteries of God are unsearchable, and it is especially declared by a~
Prophet, that a man can hardly know His counsels. (Wisd. ix. 13.) Nevertheless,~
some things have been revealed to us, and we may gather from some of the words~
and works of the Lord our Saviour, that there was a special purpose of God, in~
the fact that she who was chosen to be the mother of the Lord was espoused to a~
man. Why did not the power of the Highest overshadow her before she was so~
espoused? Perhaps it was lest any might blasphemously say that she had conceived~
in adultery the Holy One.
