!Matt 22:15-21
At that time The Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entangle Jesus~
in His talk. And so on. 
Homily by St Hilary, Bishop (of Poitiers.)
!Comm. on Matth. Can. 23
The Pharisees had oftentimes been put to confusion, and were not able to find~
any ground to accuse Him out of anything that He had hitherto said or done. His~
words and works are, of necessity, faultless, but still,from spite, they set~
themselves to seek in every direction for. some cause to accuse Him. He was~
calling all to turn away from the corruptions of the world, and the~
superstitious practices of devotion invented by men, and to fix their hopes upon~
the kingdom of heaven. They therefore arranged a question calculated to entrap~
Him into an offence against civil government, namely " Is it lawful to give~
tribute unto Caesar or not "
