Evangélium szent Máté könyvéből
!Matt 25:31-46
Azon időben mondá Jézus tanítványainak: Amikor eljön dicsőségében az Emberfia és vele minden angyal, helyet foglal fönséges trónján. Elébe gyűlnek mind a nemzetek És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!On Faith and Works, xv. 4.
If, without keeping the commandments, it be possible to attain unto life by~
faith only, (and faith, if it hath not works, is dead, James ii. 17,) how can~
it be true that the Lord will say to such as He shall have set on His left hand~
Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his~
angels? He rebuketh them, not because they have not believed in Him, but~
because they have not wrought good works. Yea, lest any man should promise~
himself life eternal by faith only, (and faith, if it hath not works, is dead,)~
the Lord saith that He will gather together all nations, nations who have lived~
mingled together in the same countries, that we may seem to hear them which have~
believed indeed in Him, but have not wrought good works, (as though that their~
dead faith could, being alone, lead them into life eternal,) that we may seem to~
hear such crying unto Him,  Lord, when saw we thee suffering such and such~
things, and did not minister unto thee?
