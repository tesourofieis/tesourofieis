Gloria

[Oratio]
Almighty and merciful God, Who made St. John Mary glorious by priestly zeal and~
untiring fervor in prayer and penance, grant, we beseech You, that by his~
example and intercession, we may have strength to win for Christ the souls of~
our brethren and, with them, attain everlasting glory.
$Per Dominum

[Secreta]
We offer You sacrifices of praise, O Lord, in memory of Your saints; trusting~
that by them we may be delivered from both present and future evils.
$Per Dominum

[Postcommunio]
Refreshed with heavenly food and drink, we humbly pray You, our God, that we~
also may be helped by his prayers in memory of whom we have partaken of these~
gifts.
