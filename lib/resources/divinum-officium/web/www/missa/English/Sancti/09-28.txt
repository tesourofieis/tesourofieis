Now that You have received our gifts and prayers, we beseech You, O Lord,~
cleanse us by Your heavenly mysteries and in Your mercy, hear us.

Grant, we beseech You, O Lord our God, that we who in this life joyously assist~
in the veneration of Your Saints, may rejoice in beholding them forever in~
heaven.
