O God, Who willed that through blessed Angela a new family of holy Virgins~
should flower in Your Church, grant us through her intercession to lead angelic~
lives, so that, foregoing all worldly pleasures, we may be found worthy to enjoy~
eternal happiness.

May the sacrificial gifts we offer You, O Lord, as we venerate the memory of~
blessed Angela, beg forgiveness for our sins and obtain for us the gifts of Your~
grace.

[Postcommunio]
Refreshed by heavenly food, we humbly pray You, O Lord, through the prayers and~
example of blessed Angela that, cleansed of every stain of body and soul, we may~
be pleasing to You.
