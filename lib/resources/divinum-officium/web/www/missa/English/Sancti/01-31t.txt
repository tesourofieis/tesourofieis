Gloria

[Oratio]
O God, You Who, as an example of Your love, divinely taught St. Peter to enrich~
Your Church with new offspring, a family of Religious devoted to the ransom of~
the faithful, grant by his intercession, that we may be released from the~
slavery of sin and rejoice in lasting freedom in heaven.
$Per Dominum

[Secreta]
We offer You sacrifices of praise, O Lord, in memory of Your saints; trusting~
that by them we may be delivered from both present and future evils.
$Per Dominum

[Postcommunio]
Refreshed with heavenly food and drink, we humbly pray You, our God, that we~
also may be helped by his prayers in memory of whom we have partaken.
