Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 9:1-6
At that time : Jesus called~
the twelve Apostles together and gave power and authority over all devils and to~
cure diseases. And so on.
_
Homily by St Buona- Ventura, (Cardinal) Bishop (of Albans,)
!On Luke ix.
Apostles are so called as a mark of their authority, for this word Apostle~
signifieth sent, and they were sent out to preach, as it is written, (1 Cor. i.~
17,) Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel. They were sent to~
preach not any small thing but a very great thing, even the Kingdom of God,~
whereby we may understand the teaching of the truth, as it is said, (Matth. xxi.~
43,) The Kingdom of God should be taken from you and given to a nation bringing~
forth the fruits thereof. The Kingdom of God may also be understood to signify~
the grace of the Holy Ghost, as it is written, (Rom. xiv. 17,) The Kingdom of~
God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy~
Ghost ; as also it was said, (Luke xvii. 21,) The Kingdom of God is within you.~
The Kingdom of God may also be understood to signify eternal glory, as it is~
said, (John iii. 5,) Ámen, I say unto thee, except a man be born again of water~
and of the Holy Ghost he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.
