Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 5:1-12
 A tömeg láttára fölment a hegyre és leült. Tanítványai köréje gyűltek És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Bk. i., on the Lord's Sermon.
At the first step in blessedness is set forth, as was behoven, the kingdom of~
heaven, the realisation of the perfect and highest wisdom of the reasonable~
soul. Thus is it said Blessed are the poor in spirit, for their's is the~
kingdom of heaven, as though it were said The fear of the Lord is the~
beginning of wisdom. Then unto the meek is given an inheritance, as the legacy~
of a father to dutiful children. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit~
the earth. Thirdly, there is comfort for such as mourn, knowing what they have~
lost, and what encompasseth them. Blessed are they that mourn (now), for they~
shall be comforted. Fourthly, the hungry and thirsty are promised that they~
shall be filled, a refreshment for the strugglers for life, and for the weary.~
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall~
be filled.
