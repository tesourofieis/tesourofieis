Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 16:13-19
Azon időben Amikor Jézus Fülöp Cezáreájának vidékére ért, megkérdezte~
tanítványaitól: "Kinek tartják az emberek az Emberfiát? És így tovább
_
Homily by Pope St Leo (the Great)
!2nd on the anniversary of his own election.
When the Lord, as we read in the Evangelist, asked His disciples : Who did men,~
amid their divers speculations, believe that He, the Son of Man, was; blessed~
Peter answered and said : Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And~
Jesus answered and said unto him : Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona : for flesh~
and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father, Which is in : and I say~
also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church,~
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it; and I will give unto thee~
the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall~
be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in~
heaven. Thus therefore standeth the ordinance of the Truth, and blessed Peter,~
abiding still that firm rock which God hath made him, hath never lost that right~
to rule in the Church which God hath given unto him.
