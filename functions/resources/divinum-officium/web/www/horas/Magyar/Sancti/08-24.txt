!Luke 6:12-19
Azon időben Jézus hogy kiment a hegyre imádkozni. Az egész éjszakát Isten~
imádásában töltötte. Amikor megvirradt, odahívta magához tanítványait. És így~
tovább.

Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. v. Comment, on Luke 6.
All they who go up into the mountain are the great and the aspiring. It is not~
to every man that the Prophet saith O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion,~
get thee up into the high mountain Thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem,~
lift up thy voice with strength. (Isa. xl. 9.) Not with bodily feet, but by high~
deeds get thee up into this mountain, and follow Christ, that thou mayest be a~
mountain thyself. Therefore it is that thou findest in the Gospel that none but~
His disciples went up into the mountain with the Lord. The Lord therefore~
prayeth, not to entreat anything for Himself, but to obtain somewhat for me. For,~
albeit the Father had given the Son power over all flesh, that He might give~
eternal life to as many as He had given Him, (John xvii. 2,) the Son Himself,~
being found in fashion as a man, (Phil. ii. 8,) thinketh well to pray the Father~
~(John xiv. 16) on our behalf, inasmuch as He is our Advocate with the Father, (1~
John ii. 1.)
