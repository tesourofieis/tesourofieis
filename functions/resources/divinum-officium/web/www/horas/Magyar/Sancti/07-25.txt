Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 20:20-25
Azon időben odament hozzá a Zebedeus fiak anyja a fiaival együtt, és leborult~
előtte, hogy kérjen tőle valamit. És így tovább.

Homily by St John Chrysostom, (Patriarch of Constantinople.)
!66th on Matth.
Let no man be troubled if we say that the Apostles were still imperfect, for the~
mystery of the Cross was not yet finished, the grace of the Spirit had not yet~
been shed abroad in their hearts. If thou wilt behold them in their strength,~
consider them such as they became after the grace of the Spirit was given them,~
and thou wilt perceive that they had trodden under foot every vain desire. This~
is the cause wherefore their present imperfection is made known unto us, that is,~
that thou mayest see how great a change could be forthwith wrought by grace. But~
nevertheless let us now look how they came unto Christ, and what they said.~
Master, they said, we would that Thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall~
desire. (Mark x. 35.) And He said unto them What would ye that I should do for~
you? (Mark X. 36) not, surely, that He knew not what their wish was, but that He would~
make them answer, and so uncover the wound, to lay a plaster upon it.
