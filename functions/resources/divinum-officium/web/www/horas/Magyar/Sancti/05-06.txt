Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 20:20-23
Azon időben odament hozzá a Zebedeus fiak anyja a fiaival együtt, és leborult~
előtte, hogy kérjen tőle valamit. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.
!Comment, on Matt. xx. Bk. 3.
Whence had the mother of Zebedee's children gotten her idea of the Lord's kingdom~
He had but just said "The Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests~
and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him~
to the Gentiles to mock, (and to scourge,) and to crucify Him." He had told His~
trembling disciples of the outrages that awaited Him in His Passion and yet~
that mother came to Him to ask for her sons a share in the glory of His Triumph. I~
think it was because the Lord, after He had said all the rest, had said also~
"And the third day He shall rise again." The woman supposed that after His~
resurrection His kingdom would immediately be established, and that that would~
be fulfilled at His first coming which is promised at His second. And so, with~
womanly haste, she forgetteth the future, and catcheth at the present.
