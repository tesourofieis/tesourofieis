Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 6:6-11
Azon időben. Egy másik szombaton bement a zsinagógába és tanított. Volt ott egy ember, akinek a jobb keze el volt sorvadva. Az írástudók és a farizeusok figyelték, vajon gyógyít-e szombaton, hogy legyen alapjuk vádat emelni ellene. És így tovább

Homily by St Peter Chrysologus.
!Sermon 32.
This man is a figure of all men. His healing is a type of their healing, and his soundness is a pledge of that soundness for which all have looked so long. The hand of man hath withered through the deadness of faith rather than through the drying up of the sinews, and by the fault of the conscience rather than by the weakness of the flesh. The withering up of man's hand hath been of old time, and a sickness which smote him at the very beginning of the world, and no art or benefit of man could heal that which had been blasted by the wrath of God. That hand had touched the forbidden thing, it had sought that which was unlawful when it had been stretched out to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. It had need of Him who had made it, not to lay a plaster upon it, but to cancel the sentence which He had uttered, and to loosen by pardon that which He had bound by judgment.
