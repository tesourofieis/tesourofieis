Evangélium szent Lukács könyvéből
!Luke 7:11-16
Azon időben Jézus Naim városába ment. Vele tartottak tanítványai és mások is~
igen sokan. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.)
!44th Discourse on the Words of the Lord.
That her son was called, again to life was the joy of that widowed mother that~
souls of men are every day called to life is the joy of our Mother the Church.~
He was dead in body they have been dead in mind. His death was outward, and~
was outwardly bewailed their inward death hath been neither mourned for nor~
seen. But He hath sought for them, Who hath seen that they are dead, and He only~
hath seen that they are dead, Who hath been able to make them alive. If He had~
not come to raise the dead, the Apostle had not said: "Awake, thou that sleepest,~
and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light." (Eph. v. 14.)
