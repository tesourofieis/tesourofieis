Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 1:29-34
Azon időben János amikor látta, hogy Jézus feléje tart, így szólt: "Nézzétek, az Isten Báránya! Ő veszi el a világ bűneit. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!6th Tract on John.
John knew Jesus even before He came to be baptized of him in Jordan, as we~
perceive by the words I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest Thou to~
me? Behold, how he knew that He was the Lord, how he knew that He was the Son~
of God! How do we prove that he knew that He it was Who should baptize with the~
Holy Ghost? Before the Lord came to the river, when many betook themselves to~
John to be baptized of him, the Baptist said I indeed baptize you with water~
but One Mightier than I cometh; the latchet of Whose shoes I am not worthy to~
unloose He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire. (Luke iii.~
16.) Behold, John knew this also.
