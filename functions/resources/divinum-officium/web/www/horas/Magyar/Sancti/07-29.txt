Azon időben Jézus betért egy faluba. Egy Márta nevű asszony befogadta házába. És~

Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!26th upon the Words of the Lord.
The words of our Lord Jesus Christ which have just been read from the Gospel,~
give us to wit that there is one thing toward the which we are making our way,~
all the while that we are striving amid the divers cares of this world.~
Thitherward we make our way, whileas we are still strangers and pilgrims,~
unpossessed as yet of any abiding city, still on the journey, not yet come home,~
still hoping, not yet enjoying. Still thitherward let us make our way, not~
slothfully nor by fits and starts, but so that some day we may arrive thither.~
Martha and Mary were sisters, not in the flesh only, but also in godliness;~
together, they clave unto the Lord; together, with one heart they served the~
Lord present in the Flesh.
