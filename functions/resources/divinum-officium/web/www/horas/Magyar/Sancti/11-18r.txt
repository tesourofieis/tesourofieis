Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 19:1-10
Abban az időben Jézus odaért Jerikóba és végigment rajta. Élt ott egy Zakeus~
nevű tehetős ember, a vámosok feje. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great,)
!Bk. xxviii. of Moral Reflections on Job ch. 27.
If we would be truly wise, and behold wisdom herself, we must humbly acknowledge~
ourselves to be fools. Let us cast away harmful wisdom, and learn praiseworthy~
folly. For this reason indeed is it written God hath chosen the foolish things~
of the world, to confound the wise. (1 Cor. i. 27.) And again it is said If~
any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that~
he may be wise. (iii. 18.) And unto this doth the very Gospel bear witness,~
wherein it is said that Zacchasus sought to see Jesus, Who He was; and could not~
for the press, because he was little of stature. And he ran before, and climbed~
up into a sycamore tree to see Him; for He was to pass that way. For this name~
Sycamore, being interpreted, signifieth the Foolish Fig.
