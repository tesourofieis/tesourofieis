[Lectio7]
Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 5:43-48
Azon időben így szólt Jézus tanítványaihoz: Hallottátok a parancsot: Szeresd~
felebarátodat, és gyűlöld ellenségedet. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.
!Bk. i., Cowan. onMatth. v. and vi.
 But I say unto you Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you. There~
are many who judge of the commandments of the Lord by their own weakness, and~
not by the strength of His Saints and so deem Him to have commanded things~
impossible. These are they who think that not to hate their enemies is all that~
they are able to do and that to command us to love them, is to command more~
than man's nature can bear. It behoveth then to know, that this which Christ~
commandeth is not impossible, albeit perfect. This is what David did in respect~
of Saul and Absalom the martyr Stephen also prayed for his enemies, even while~
they were stoning him and Paul could wish that himself were accursed from~
Christ for his persecutors. (Rom. ix. well as taught, when He said Father,~
forgive them for they know not what they do. (Luke xxiii. 34.)
