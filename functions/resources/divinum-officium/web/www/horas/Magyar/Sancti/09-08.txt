Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 1:1-17
Jézus Krisztus, Dávid fiának, Ábrahám fiának nemzetségtáblája. Ábrahám nemzette~
Izsákot, Izsák nemzette Jákobot És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. i. Comm. on Matth.
In Isaiah (liii. 8) we read: "Who shall declare His generation?" Let us not~
think that there is any contradiction between the Prophet and the Evangelist,~
because the Prophet saith that this thing cannot be done, and the Evangelist~
beginneth by doing it. The one speaketh of the generation of the Divine (Word by~
the Eternal Father,) the other of the (family in which the) Incarnation (took~
place.) Matthew beginneth with carnal things, that by learning of men we may go~
on to learn of God. " The Son of David, the son of Abraham." The reversal of the~
order in these clauses is a needful change. If Abraham had been put first and~
David afterwards, Abraham would have had to be taken again, in order to marshal~
the pedigree properly.
