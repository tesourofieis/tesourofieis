Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 18:1-5
Azon időben odamentek Jézushoz a tanítványok és megkérdezték tőle: "Ki a~
legnagyobb a mennyek országában?" És így tovább.
_
Homily by St John Chrysostom, Patriarch (of Constantinople.)
!60th on Matth. xviii.
Take heed, saith Jesus, that ye despise not one of these little ones, for I say~
unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father and~
that for their sake am I come, and this is the will of My Father. Hereby the~
Lord stirreth us up to guard and save these little ones. Thou seest how mighty~
are the walls which He raiseth to protect little children, and how great thought~
and care He hath lest they should be lost, threatening on the one hand the~
uttermost punishment against whosoever shall offend one of these little ones~
which believe in Him, (6) and promising on the other hand, the highest reward to~
whosoever shall receive one such little child in His Name, (5) and this His~
teaching He giveth both in His Own, and in His Father's Name.
