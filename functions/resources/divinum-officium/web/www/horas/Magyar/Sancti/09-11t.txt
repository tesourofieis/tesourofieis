!Matt 1:1-17
Jézus Krisztus, Dávid fiának, Ábrahám fiának nemzetségtáblája. Ábrahám nemzette~
Izsákot, Izsák nemzette Jákobot És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Hilary, Bishop (of Poitiers.)
!Comment, on Matth. i.)
By the generation which Matthew noteth in the Kingly, and Luke in the Priestly~
descent of our Lord, both mean to show His relationship with each race, and both~
reach it in the clear line of the pedigree which they are tracing, for that~
connection between the Kingly and Priestly houses which was begun by the~
marriage of David was fully accomplished in the link between Salathiel and~
Zorobabel. And so while Matthew recordeth the line from father to son coming~
down from Judah, and Luke teacheth the descent from the tribe of Levi through~
Nathan, both prove that by His forefathers our Lord Jesus, Who is already a King~
and a Priest from everlasting to everlasting, hath also the right to these~
dignities by earthly inheritance.
