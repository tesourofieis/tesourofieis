Evangélium Szt Máté könyvéből
!Matt 1:1-17
Jézus Krisztus, Dávid fiának, Ábrahám fiának nemzetségtáblája. Ábrahám nemzette~
Izsákot, Izsák nemzette Jákobot És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Bk. iii. upon the Harmony of the Gospels, I.
The Evangelist Matthew beginneth thus The book of the generation of Jesus~
Christ, the Son of David, the son of Abraham. By this beginning he sufficiently~
showeth that he taketh upon him to tell the generation of Christ according to~
the Flesh. It is by this generation that Christ is the Son of Man, a title~
whereby He oftentimes calleth Himself, pointing out unto us what He hath been~
mercifully pleased to become for our sakes. As to His higher and eternal~
Generation, by Which He is the Only-begotten Son of God, begotten before any~
creature, and by Whom all things were made, it is so indescribable that the~
Prophet may be understood to point to it where he saith who shall declare His~
generation? (Isa. liii. 8.)
