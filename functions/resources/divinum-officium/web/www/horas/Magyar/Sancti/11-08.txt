Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 5:1-12
 A tömeg láttára fölment a hegyre és leült. Tanítványai köréje gyűltek És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Bk. i. on the Lord's Sermon.
Blessed are ye, saith the Lord, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,~
and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice, and~
be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven. If any be seeking under~
the name of a Christian the pleasures of this world and the possession of~
temporal goods, let him bethink him that our blessedness is inward, even as the~
mouth of the Prophet saith concerning the soul of the Church The King's~
daughter is all glorious within. (Ps. xliv. 15.) Without, she is reviled, and~
persecution and evil report are her promised portion. And yet for these very~
things, great is her reward in heaven, as indeed is felt in the hearts of the~
sufferers, at least of such as are able already to say But we glory in~
tribulations also; knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience,~
experience; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love~
of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, Which is given unto us.~
~(Rom. v. 3-5.)
