Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 1:1-16
Jézus Krisztus, Dávid fiának, Ábrahám fiának nemzetségtáblája. Ábrahám nemzette~
Izsákot, Izsák nemzette Jákobot. És így~
tovább.

Homily by St John of Damascus.
!Bk. iv. on the Orthodox Faith.
That Joseph sprang from the lineage of David, the most holy Evangelists Matthew~
and Luke have clearly shown. There is this difference between them, that Matthew~
traceth the pedigree from David through Solomon, and Luke through Nathan. But~
both of them pass in silence over the descent of the Holy Virgin. In explanation~
of this we shall find on investigation that among the Jews, and in the Holy~
Scriptures, it hath never been in use to chronicle the pedigrees of women. But~
the Law containeth a warning against the tribes intermarrying one with another.~
Joseph was of the same tribe as David, (namely, Judah,) and since he was a just~
man (this is the praise which the Gospel of God giveth him,) he would not have~
espoused the Holy Virgin, unless she had been of the same race, as such an union~
would not have been in accordance with the commandment of the law. For this~
reason the Evangelist held it enough to have shown the descent of Joseph.
