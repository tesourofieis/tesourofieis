From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 1:57-68
57 Elérkezett Erzsébet szülésének ideje, és fiút szült.
58 Amikor a szomszédok és rokonok meghallották, hogy milyen nagyra méltatta az~
Úr irgalmában, vele örültek. És így tovább
_
From the Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!Bk. ii. on Luke's
And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied. Behold~
how good is God, and how ready to forgive sinners Not only doth He give back~
that which He hath taken away, but He addeth moreover such and such things, more~
than either we ask or think. He that had hitherto been dumb, now speaketh~
prophecy. But the greatest grace of God is in this, that he which had denied,~
now maketh profession. Therefore let no man despair, nay, though he well knoweth~
what have been his past sins, let him never give up hope of a reward from God.~
If thou knowest how to amend thy crooked ways, God knoweth how to turn away the~
judgments of His anger.
