Evangélium Szt Lukács könyvéből
!Luke 1:57-65
Elérkezett Erzsébet szülésének ideje, és fiút szült. Amikor a szomszédok és rokonok meghallották, hogy milyen nagyra méltatta az Úr irgalmában, vele örültek. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!Bk ii. on Luke i.
 He shall be called John. Elizabeth who had herself prophesied of Christ, could~
not fail to recognise the Fore-runner of the Lord. It is well added: There is~
none of thy kindred that is called by this name whereby we know that he was~
named, not as the son of Zacharias, but as the Prophet of God. And they made~
signs to his father, how he would have him called  but since unbelief had~
bereft him of voice and hearing, he was not able to answer them by word of mouth,~
and he asked for a writing-table and wrote, saying : His name is John.

their hands, the grace always in all things to remain faithful to their~
teaching.
