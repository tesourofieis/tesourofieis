Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 18:1-10
 Abban az időben odamentek Jézushoz a tanítványok és megkérdezték tőle: "Ki a~
legnagyobb a mennyek országában?" És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. iii. Comm. on Matth. xviii.
After the finding of the piece of money in the fish's mouth, after the payment~
of the tribute, what meaneth this sudden question of the Apostles? Who is the~
greatest in the kingdom of heaven? They had seen that the same tribute-money~
was paid for Peter as for the Lord, and from this equality of reckoning they~
gathered that Peter was Prince of all the Apostles, seeing that he had been~
appraised at the same price as his Master. Therefore they ask, Who is the~
greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus, seeing their thoughts, and~
understanding wherefore they erred, is fain to take away the desire of glory by~
the love of lowliness.
