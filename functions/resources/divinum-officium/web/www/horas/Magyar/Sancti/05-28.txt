Azon időben az Úr kiválasztott más hetvenkettőt, és elküldte őket kettesével maga előtt minden városba és helységbe, ahová menni készült. És így tovább.

Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!Homilia 17th on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, our Lord and Saviour doth sometimes admonish us by words, and sometimes by works. Yea, His very works do themselves teach us for that which He doth silently His example still moveth us to copy. Behold how He sendeth forth His disciples to preach by two and two since there are two commandments to love, that is, a commandment to love God, and a commandment to love our neighbour and where there are not two, the one, being alone, hath not whereon to do the Lord's commandment. And no man can properly be said to love himself: for love tendeth outward toward our neighbour, if it be thelove whereto the Gospel doth oblige us.
