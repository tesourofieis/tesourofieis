Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 9:1-38
Azon időben Jézus látott egy vakon született embert. Tanítványai megkérdezték tőle: Mester, ki vétkezett, ez vagy a szülei, hogy vakon született? És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!44th Tract on John.
Dread and wondrous are all the things which our Lord Jesus Christ did, both His~
works and His words; the works, because He wrought them; the words, because they~
are deep. If, therefore, we consider the meaning of this work of His, we see~
that that man which was blind from his birth was a figure of mankind. This~
spiritual blindness was the consequence of the sin of the first man, from whom~
we all inherit by birth, not death only, but depravity also. For if blindness be~
unbelief, and faith, light, whom, when Christ came, did He find faithful? May,~
the Apostle who had himself been born of the race of which the Prophets came,~
saith We also were by nature children of wrath, even as others. (Eph. ii. 3.)~
And if children of wrath, then children also of vengeance, children of damnation,~
children of hell. And wherefore so by nature, unless it were that the sin of the~
first man had made all his descendants to be born in sin, in that they partook~
of his nature? If, then, our nature bring sin with it, all men, according to the~
spirit, are born blind.
