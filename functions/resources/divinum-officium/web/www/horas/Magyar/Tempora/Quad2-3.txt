Evangélium szent Máté könyvéből
!Matt 20:17-28
Azon időben Jézus Jeruzsálembe készült fölmenni, maga mellé vette a tizenkettőt, s ezt mondta nekik az úton: Most fölmegyünk Jeruzsálembe. Ott a főpapok és írástudók kezére adják az Emberfiát. Azok halálra ítélik És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. v. to Gratian, on Faith, c. ii.
Consider what it was that the mother of Zebedee's children came to Christ~
desiring, with, and for her sons. She was a mother, who, longing for the honour~
of her sons, preferred a request immoderate, and yet pardonable. She was a~
mother who, albeit stricken in years and comfortless, at an age when she had~
sore need of the strength of her offspring to help and keep her, was yet so~
earnest in godliness and motherly love, that she had liefer suffer the loss of~
her sons, that they might gain the reward of following Christ still, as we read~
they had already done, when, at the first call of the Lord, they left their nets~
and their father, (iv. 21, 22.)
