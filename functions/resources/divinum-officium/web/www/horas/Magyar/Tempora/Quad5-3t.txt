Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 10:22-38
Azon időben a templomszentelés ünnepét ülték Jeruzsálemben. Tél volt. Jézus éppen a templomban járt, Salamon csarnokában. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo. )
!42th Tract on John.
The Greek word Enkainia, used by the Evangelist, signifieth the Feast of the Dedication of the Temple. The derivation thereof is kainon, which is, being interpreted, new; and the Dedication of anything new is thence called Enkainia. The use of this word is still preserved among ourselves; if any man put on his new coat for the first time we say that he enkainiateth. It was the use of the Jews to keep solemn holiday upon the Anniversary of the Dedication of the Temple, and this was the Feast-day which was being observed when the Lord spake the words which have been read.
