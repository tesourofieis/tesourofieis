Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 11:1-45
Azon időben Betániában, Máriának és nővérének, Mártának a falujában volt egy beteg, Lázár. És így tovább.

Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!49 Tract on John.
Ye remember that in our last reading we learnt how that the Lord escaped out of the hands of them which took up stones to stone Him, and went away again beyond Jordan, into the place where John at first baptized. (John x. 31, 39, 40- ) While, then, the Lord still tarried there, Lazarus was sick at Bethany, which was a town near to Jerusalem. It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His Feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. Therefore his sisters sent unto Him. We know already whither it was that they sent, for we know where Jesus was He was gone away again beyond Jordan. His sisters sent unto Him, saying Lord, behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick in order that, if He so pleased, He might come and free him from his sickness. But Jesus healed not, that He might afterward quicken.
