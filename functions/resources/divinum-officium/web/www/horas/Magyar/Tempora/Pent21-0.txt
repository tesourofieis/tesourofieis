Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 18:23-35
At that time Jesus spake unto His disciples this parable The kingdom of heaven~
is likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. And so~
on.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk, iii. Comment, on Matth. xviii.
It is a way much in use with the Syrians, and especially with the inhabitants of~
Palestine, to illustrate their discourse with parables, that what their hearers~
may not be able to catch so easily when spoken plainly, they may lay hold on by~
dint of comparisons and examples. Thus it was that the Lord, by an allegory~
about a Royal master and a servant who owed him ten thousand talents, and who~
obtained by entreaty forgiveness of the debt, taught Peter how it was his duty~
to forgive his fellow-servants their comparatively trifling offences. For if~
that Royal master so readily forgave his servant his debt of ten thousand~
talents, should not his servants much more forgive lesser debts unto their~
fellows
