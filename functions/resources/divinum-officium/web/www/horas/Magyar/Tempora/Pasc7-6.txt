Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 4:38
Azon időben Jézus a zsinagógából kijőve, Simon házába ment. Simon anyósa magas lázban feküdt. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan
!Bk. iv. on Luke iv.
Behold here how long-suffering is the Lord our Redeemer Neither moved to anger against them, nor sickened at their guilt, nor outraged by their attacks, did He leave the Jews' country. Nay, forgetting their iniquity, and mindful only of His mercy, He strove to soften their hard and unbelieving hearts, sometimes by His teaching, and sometimes by freeing some of them, and sometimes by healing them. St Luke doth well to tell us first of the man who was delivered from an unclean spirit, and then of the healing of a woman. The Lord indeed came to heal both sexes, but that must be healed first which was created first, and then must not she be passed by whose first sin arose rather from fickleness of heart than from depraved will.
