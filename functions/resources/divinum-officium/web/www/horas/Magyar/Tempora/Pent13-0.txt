!Luke 17:11-19
It came to pass, as Jesus went to Jerusalem, that He passed through the midst of~
Samaria and Galilee. And, as He entered into a certain village, there met Him~
ten men that were lepers. And so on.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo
!Bk. ii. Gospel Questions, ch. 40.
The ten lepers "lifted up their voices and said Jesus, Master, have mercy on~
us. And when He saw them, He said unto them Go, show yourselves unto the~
Priests. And it came to pass that, as they went, they were cleansed." Question~
why did the Lord send them unto the Priests, that, as they went, they might be~
cleansed Lepers were the only class among those upon whose bodies He worked~
mercy, whom we find that He sent unto the Priests. It is written in another~
place that He said to a leper whom He had cleansed " Go, and show thyself to~
the Priest, and offer for thy cleansing according as Moses commanded, for a~
testimony unto them" (Luke v. 14, Lev. xiv. et seq.) We ask then, of what leprosy was a type, whereof they that were~
ridded were called, not "healed," but " cleansed." It is a disease which doth~
first appear in the skin, but destroyeth not immediately the strength, nor the~
use of feeling and the limbs.
