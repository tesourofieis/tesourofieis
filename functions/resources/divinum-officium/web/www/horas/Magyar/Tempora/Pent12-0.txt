!Luke 10:23-37
At that time Jesus said unto His disciples Blessed are the eyes which see~
the things that ye see. For I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired~
to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them. And so on.
_
Homily by the Venerable Bede, Priest at Jarrow.
!Bk. iii. ch. 43 on Luke x.
Blessed were the eyes not of Scribes and Pharisees, which saw but the Body of~
the Lord, but those eyes, eyes blessed indeed, which were able to see those~
things whereof it is written "Thou hast hid these things from the wise and~
prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes." Blessed are the eyes of those~
little ones unto whom it seemeth good in the eyes of the Son to reveal Himself~
and the Father also. Abraham rejoiced to see the day of Christ and he saw it,~
and was glad. (John viii. 56.) Isaiah, and Micah, and many among the Prophets,~
saw the glory of the Lord, wherefore also they be called Seers, but all they~
beheld it and hailed it afar off, seeing but as through a glass, darkly. (1 Cor.~
xiii. 12.)
