Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 9:1-6
Azon időben Jézus összehívta a tizenkettőt, erőt és hatalmat adott nekik a gonosz lelkek fölött és a betegségek gyógyítására. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!Bk. vi. on Luke ix.
We learn from the commandments of the Gospel what manner of mer they ought to be who preach the glad tidings of the kingdom of God "Take nothing for your journey neither staves nor scrip, neither bread neither money." Thus let the Apostle destitute of earthly help, and panoplies in faith, deem himself able to do all the more, as he needeth all the less Such as please may also put upon these words a spiritual interpretation in that a man may be said to lay as the encumbrances of the body, not only by abdicating power, and casting away riches, but also by denying the very body itself its pleasures. The first general commandment given to the Apostles touching their manners was to be bringers of peace, (Matth. x. 13,) and to be no gadders about, but keepers of the laws of guests. To wander from house to house, and to abuse the rights of hospitality, are things alien to a preacher of the kingdom of heaven.
