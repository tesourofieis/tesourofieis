[Lectio1]
From the holy Gospel according to Luke
!Luke 16:19-31
Azon időben mondá Jézus a farizeusoknak: Volt egy gazdag ember. Bíborban és patyolatban járt, és mindennap nagy lakomát rendezett És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!40th on the Gospels.
Whom, dearly beloved brethren, whom are we to understand as signified by that~
rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every~
day, whom, I ask, are we to understand, but the Jewish people, who had all the~
outward life of religious ordinances, and who turned the treasure of the law~
they had received to show and not to use? What but the herd of the Gentiles is~
figured in Lazarus, full of sores? Whosoever turneth himself to God and is not~
ashamed to confess his sin, hath his sores on the skin, for in a sore on the~
skin breaketh out the corruption, which is drawn from within.
