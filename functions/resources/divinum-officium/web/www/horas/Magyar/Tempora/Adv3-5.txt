Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 1:39-47
Azon időben Mária útnak indult, és a hegyekbe sietett, Júda városába. Zakariás~
házába tért be és üdvözölte Erzsébetet. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan,)
!Commentary on Luke, Bk. ii. c
When any one asketh another for credence, he is bound to give some reasonable~
ground. And so the Angel, when he announced to Mary the counsel of God, gave,~
as a proof, the conception of Elizabeth, then aged and barren, that Mary might~
perceive, by this example, that with God nothing is impossible. When the holy~
Virgin had heard it, she arose and went to visit her cousin. She did not go to~
see if what she had heard was true, because she did not believe God, or because~
she knew not who the messenger had been, or yet because she doubted the fact~
adduced in proof. She went joyfully as one who hath received a mercy in answer~
to his vow goeth to pay the same. She went with devotion, as a godly person~
goeth to execute a religious duty. She went into the hill country in joyful~
haste. And is it not something that she went up into the hills? God was already~
in her womb, and her feeling bore her continually upward. The grace of the Holy~
Spirit knoweth no slow working.
