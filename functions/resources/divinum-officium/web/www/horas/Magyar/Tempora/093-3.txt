Evangélium szent Márk Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Mark 9:16-28
Azon időben valaki így szól Jézushoz a tömegből: Mester, elhoztam hozzád a~
fiamat, akit néma lélek szállt meg. And so on.
_
Homily by the Venerable Bede, Priest (at Jarrow.)
!Bk. iii. ch. 38, on Mark ix.
Concerning this possessed person whom the Lord healed, after that He was come~
down from the mount, Mark saith that he was deaf and dumb, and Matthew (xvii.~
15) that he was lunatic. He was a figure of them of whom it is said A fool~
changeth as the moon, (Ecclus. xxvii. 12.) These are they who continue never in~
one stay, but change now to one sin, and now to another, waxing and waning dumb,~
in that they confess not the faith deaf, in that they have no ears for the~
word of truth. They foam at the mouth also, and pine away with folly. For it is~
the way with idiots, and swooners, and stupified, to foam their spittle out at~
their mouths. They gnash their teeth when they are inflamed with the heat of~
passion. They wither up in the paralysis of sloth and live nerveless lives~
unbraced by any strong exercise.
