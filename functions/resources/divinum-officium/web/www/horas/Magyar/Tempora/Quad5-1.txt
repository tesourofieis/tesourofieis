Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 7:32-39
Azon időben a főpapok és a farizeusok elküldték szolgáikat, hogy fogják el. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.) 
!31th Tract on John. 
How could they take Him until such time as He willed to be taken? If, then, they could not take Him until He willed to be taken, were they sent to watch His teaching? Then said Jesus unto them Yet a little while am I with you  what ye now seek to do, ye shall do; but not yet, for I will not so yet. And why will I not so yet? Because yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto Him that sent Me  I must fulfil that which I am sent to do, and so go to suffer.
