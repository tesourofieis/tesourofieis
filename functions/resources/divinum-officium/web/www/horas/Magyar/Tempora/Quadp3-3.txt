Evangélium szent Máté könyvéből
!Matt 6:16-21
Azon időben mondá Jézus tanítványainak: Amikor böjtöltök, ne öltsetek olyan ábrázatot, mint a képmutatók, akik komorrá változtatják arcukat És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Bk. ii. on the Lord's Sermon on the Mounts ch. xii. torn. 4.
It is evident that by these precepts we are bidden to seek for inner gladness,~
lest, by running after that reward which is without, we should become conformed~
to the fashion of this world, and should so lose the promise of that blessing~
which is all the truer and more stable that it is inward, that blessing wherein~
God hath chosen us to be conformed to the likeness of His Son. In this chapter~
we will principally consider the fact that vain-glory findeth a ground for its~
exercise in struggling poverty as much as in worldly distinction and display;~
and this development is the most dangerous, because it entices under pretence of~
being the serving of God.
