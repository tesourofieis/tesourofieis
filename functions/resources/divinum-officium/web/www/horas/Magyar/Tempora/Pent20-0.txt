!John 4:46-53

And so on.

Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!Holmily 28 on the Gospels.)
My brethren the passage from the Holy Gospel, which ye have just now heard,~
standeth in need of no explanation. But lest I should seem to pass the same by~
in idle silence, I will say somewhat thereon, but that rather by way of~
exhortation than of explanation. Indeed, there seemeth to me to be but one point~
which calleth for explanation, and that point is this Wherefore was it that~
when the nobleman went unto the Lord, and besought Him that He would come down~
and heal his son, "Jesus said unto him: Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will~
not believe " The very fact that he had come to beseech Christ to heal his son,~
putteth it beyond all doubt that this nobleman believed if he had not believed~
Him to be a Saviour, he would not have asked Him to save his son. Wherefore then "~
said Jesus unto him Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe "~
since he was one who had not seen, and yet had believed
