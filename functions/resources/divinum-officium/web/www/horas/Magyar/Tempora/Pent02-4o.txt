Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 6:56-59
Aki eszi az én testemet és issza az én véremet, az bennem marad, én meg benne. Engem az élő Atya küldött, s általa élek. Így az is élni fog általam, aki engem eszik. És így tovább

Homily by St Cyril, Pope of Alexandria.
!Book iv. on John, ch. 17.
"He that eateth My Flesh and drinketh My Blood," saith the Lord, "dwelleth in Me, and I in him." If a man take two pieces of wax and melt them, and pour the one into the other, they necessarily mingle so also, he that receiveth the Body and Blood of the Lord doth become so joined with the Lord that he is to be found in Christ and Christ in him. Another comparison thou wilt find in Matthew. The Lord there saith "The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, [till the whole was leavened,]" (xiii. 33,)~
because, as Paul saith, "a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump." (Gal. v. 9.) So also doth a little of this Blessing draw the whole man unto Itself, and fill him with Its grace and thus doth Christ dwell in us, and we in Christ.
