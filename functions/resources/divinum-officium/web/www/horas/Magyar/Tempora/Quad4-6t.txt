Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 8:12-20
Azon időben mondá Jézus a zsidók seregeinek: Én vagyok a világ világossága. Aki követ, nem jár többé sötétségben, hanem övé lesz az élet világossága. És így tovább.

Homily on this passage by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!34 Tract on John.
I take it that these words of the Lord I am the Light of the world are sufficiently clear to all men who have eyes which see that Light. At the same time, such men as have no eyes except those which are in their bodies, are surprised to find our Lord Jesus Christ saying, I am the Light of the world. And that we might not want somebody to say, Is our Lord Jesus Christ, then, the same sun that riseth and setteth every day? there have actually been heretics who did say it. The Manichasans believed that that sun which we see with our bodily eyes, and to see which is plain and common to beasts as well as men, was the Lord Christ.
