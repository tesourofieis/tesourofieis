Evangélium szent Máté könyvéből
!Matt 5:43-48; 6:1-4
Azon időben mondá Jézus tanítványainak: Hallottátok a parancsot: Szeresd felebarátodat, és gyűlöld ellenségedet. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. i. Comm. on Matth. v. and vi. )
 But I say unto you Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you. There~
are many who judge of the commandments of the Lord by their own weakness, and~
not by the strength of His Saints; and so deem Him to have commanded things~
impossible. These are they who think that not to hate their enemies is all that~
they are able to do; and that to command us to love them, is to command more~
than man's nature can bear. It behoveth them to know, that this which Christ~
commandeth is not impossible, albeit perfect. This is what David did in respect~
of Saul and Absalom; the martyr Stephen also prayed for his enemies, even while~
they were stoning him; and Paul could wish that himself were accursed from~
Christ for his persecutors. (Rom. ix. 3.) And this, Jesus Himself did, as well~
as taught, when He said Father, forgive them for they know not what they~
do. (Luke xxiii. 34.)
