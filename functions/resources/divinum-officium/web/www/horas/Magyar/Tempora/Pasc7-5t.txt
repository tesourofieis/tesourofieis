Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 5:17-26
Azon időben amikor Jézus tanított, farizeusok és törvénytudók is ültek ott, akik Galilea és Júdea különféle falvaiból és Jeruzsálemből jöttek. Az Úr ereje gyógyításra ösztönözte. És így tovább.

Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
!Bk. v. on Luke v.
And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy." The healing of this paralytic was not idle, nor its fruits limited to himself. The Lord healed him, or ever he could ask, not because of the entreaties of others, but for example's" sake. He gave a pattern to be followed, and sought not the~
intercession of prayer. In the presence of the Pharisees and doctors of the law, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem, many sick folk were healed, but among them is specially described the healing of this paralytic. First of all, as we have before said, every sick man ought to engage his friends to offer up prayers for his recovery, that so the tottering framework of this our life, and the distorted feet of our works, may be righted by the healing power of the word from heaven.
