Evangélium szent Máté könyvéből
!Matt 21:33-46
Azon időben mondá Jézus a zsidók seregeinek: Halljatok egy másik példabeszédet. Volt egy gazda, aki szőlőt telepített. Bekerítette sövénnyel És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. ix. on Luke xx.
Many derive divers spiritual meanings from the term vineyard, but Isaias giveth~
us to know that the vineyard of the Lord of Sabaoth is the house of Israel, (v.~
7.) Who but God planted that vineyard? He it was that let it out to husbandmen,~
and went into a far country; not that the Lord, Who is everywhere present,~
moveth from place to place; but because He is nigh unto them that seek Him, and~
from such as regard Him not He standeth afar off. For a long time He tarried~
away, lest He might seem to ask too early for the fruits of His vineyard. For~
where kindness is greatest, there ingratitude is worst.
