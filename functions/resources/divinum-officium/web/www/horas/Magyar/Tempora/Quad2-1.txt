Lectio sancti Evangelii secundum Joannem
!John 8:21-29
Azon időben mondá Jézus a zsidók seregeinek: Elmegyek és kerestek, de bűnötökben~
haltok meg. Ahova ugyanis én megyek, oda ti nem jöhettek. És így tovább.
_
Homily on this passage by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!Tract 38 on John.
The Lord spake unto the Jews, saying I go My way for, to the Lord Christ,~
death was a departure to that place whence He had come, and whence He had never~
departed. I go My way, saith He, and ye shall seek Me not from love, but from~
hatred. Yea after He had withdrawn Himself from the sight of men, two classes~
sought Him, even they that loved, and they that hated Him; the one because they~
longed for His presence, the other because they were fain to hunt Him down. In~
the Psalms the Lord Himself saith by His Prophet: Refuge failed me, and no man~
cared for my soul. (Ps. cxli. 5.) And again He said in another Psalm Let them~
be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul. (Ps. xxxiv.)
