[Lectio7]
Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 9:1-8
At that time Jesus entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into His own~
city. And so on.
_
Homily by St Peter Chrysologus, Archbishop (of Ravenna.)
!Sermon 50.
This day's reading hath shown us an instance of how Christ, in those things~
which He did as Man, worked deep works of God, and by things which were seen~
wrought things which were not seen. The Evangelist saith Jesus " entered into a~
ship, and passed over, and came into His Own city." Was not This He Who had once~
parted the waves hither and thither, and made the dry ground appear at the~
bottom of the sea, so that His people Israel passed dry-shod between masses of~
water standing still, as through an hollow glen in a mountain Was not This He~
Who made the depths of the sea solid under the feet of Peter, so that the watery~
path offered a firm way for human footsteps
