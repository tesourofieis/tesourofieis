Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 3:1-6
Tiberius császár uralkodásának 15. esztendejében, amikor Poncius Pilátus volt Júdea helytartója És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great,)
!10th on the Gospels.
The date, at which the Fore-runner of our Redeemer entered on his public office~
of preaching, is indicated to us by the name of the ruler of the Roman~
Commonwealth, and by those of the princes of Palestine. The time of his~
preaching is indicated by these names, because he came as the Fore-runner of Him~
Who was to be the Redeemer of some Jews and many Gentiles. Moreover in the~
enumeration of these worldly monarchs there is a foreshadowing of the fact, that~
the Gentiles were about to be gathered into one, and the Jews to be scattered~
abroad in punishment of their unbelief; in the whole heathen Commonwealth we~
find the title of one Emperor, but in the small kingdom of Judaea are mentioned~
four masters.
