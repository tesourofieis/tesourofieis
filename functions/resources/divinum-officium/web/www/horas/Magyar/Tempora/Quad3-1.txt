Evangélium szent Lukács könyvéből
!Luke 4:23-30
Azon időben mondá Jézus a faizeusokhoz: Így szólt hát hozzájuk: Biztosan ezt a mondást szegezitek majd nekem: Orvos, magadat gyógyítsd! A nagy tetteket, amelyeket - mint hallottuk - Kafarnaumban végbevittél, vidd végbe itt, a hazádban is! És így tovább.

Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. iv. on Luke iv.
Here we have a display of a spite not very common. Their hatred of Christ, and~
their desire to find grounds for that hatred in what in Him appealed for their~
love, had made them forget their local friendliness to a fellow-citizen. By this~
example as well as by God's declaration, thou mayest learn that thou wilt wait~
in vain to be holpen of His mercy, whilst thou art envious of the spiritual good~
of thy neighbour. Yea, the Lord turneth Him away from the envious, and will not~
show the mighty works of His power to such as are bitter against His gifts to~
others. The example of Himself which God hath been pleased to set before us is~
that of His doings in the Flesh, and it is by these His doings which He suffered~
to be seen, that we are taught touching those which are unseen.
