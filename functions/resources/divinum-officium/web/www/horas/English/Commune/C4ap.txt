[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 5:13-19
At that time Jesus said unto His disciples Ye are the salt of the earth. But~
if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted And so on.
_
Homily by St Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers.
!Comment, on Matth. V
Ye are the salt of the earth. But if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith~
shall it be salted It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and~
to be trodden under foot of men. There is, I take it, no such thing as salt of~
the earth. How, then, can the Apostles be called the salt of the earth? But the~
true meaning of these words will be made plain, when we consider the duty of~
Apostles, and the nature of salt itself. Now, salt is a compound of the elements~
of water and fire, out of the which two things in salt there is made one.

[Oratio2]
God, Who didst give unto thy people thy blessed servant N., to feed them with~
