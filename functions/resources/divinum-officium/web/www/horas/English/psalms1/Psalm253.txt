(Canticum Isaiae * Isa 61:6-9)
61:6 But you shall be called the priests of the Lord: * to you it shall be said: You ministers of our God:
61:6 You shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, * and you shall pride yourselves in their glory.
61:7 For your double confusion and shame, * they shall praise their part:
61:7 Therefore shall they receive double in their land, * everlasting joy shall be unto them.
61:8 For I am the Lord that loves judgment, * and hates robbery in a holocaust:
61:8 And I will make their work in truth, * and I will make a perpetual covenant with them.
61:9 And they shall know their seed among the Gentiles, * and their offspring in the midst of peoples:
61:9 All that shall see them, shall know them, * that these are the seed which the Lord has blessed.
