(Canticum Habacuc * Hab 3:1-6)
3:1 O Lord, I have heard thy hearing, * and was afraid.
3:2 O Lord, thy work, * in the midst of the years bring it to life:
3:2 In the midst of the years thou shalt make it known: * when thou art angry, thou wilt remember mercy.
3:3 God will come from the south, * and the holy one from mount Pharan:
3:3 His glory covered the heavens, * and the earth is full of his praise.
3:4 His brightness shall be as the light; * horns are in his hands:
3:4 There is his strength hid: * Death shall go before his face.
3:5 And the devil shall go forth before his feet. * He stood and measured the earth.
3:6 He beheld, and melted the nations: * and the ancient mountains were crushed to pieces.
3:6 The hills of the world were bowed down * by the journeys of his eternity.
