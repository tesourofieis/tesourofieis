(Canticum Proverb * Prov. 9:1-6, 10-12)
9:1 Wisdom has built herself a house, she has hewn her out seven pillars.
9:2 She has slain her victims, mingled her wine, and set forth her table.
9:3 She has sent her maids to invite to the tower, and to the walls of the city:
9:4 Whosoever is a little one, let him come to me. And to the unwise she said:
9:5 Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine which I have mingled for you.
9:6 Forsake childishness, and live, and walk by the ways of prudence.
9:10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is prudence.
9:11 For by me shall your days be multiplied, and years of life shall be added to you.
9:12 If you be wise, you shall be so to yourself: and if a scorner, you alone shall bear the evil.
