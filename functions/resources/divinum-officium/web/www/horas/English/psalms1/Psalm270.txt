(Canticle from Lamentations * Lam 5:1-7,15-17,19-21)
5:1 Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us: * consider and behold our reproach.
5:2 Our inheritance is turned to aliens: * our houses to strangers.
5:3 We are become orphans without a father: * our mothers are as widows.
5:4 We have drunk our water for money: * we have bought our wood.
5:5 We were dragged by the necks, * we were weary and no rest was given us.
5:6 We have given our hand to Egypt, and to the Assyrians, * that we might be satisfied with bread.
5:7 Our fathers have sinned, and are not: * and we have borne their iniquities.
5:15 The joy of our heart is ceased, * our dancing is turned into mourning.
5:16 The crown is fallen from our head: * woe to us, because we have sinned.
5:17 Therefore is our heart sorrowful, * therefore are our eyes become dim.
5:19 But thou, O Lord, shalt remain for ever, * thy throne from generation to generation.
5:20 Why wilt thou forget us for ever? * why wilt thou forsake us for a long time?
5:21 Convert us, O Lord, to thee, and we shall be converted: * renew our days, as from the beginning.
