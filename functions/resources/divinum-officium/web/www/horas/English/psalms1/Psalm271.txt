(Canticle of Ezechiel * Ez 36:24-28)
36:24 For I will take you from among the Gentiles, and will gather you together out of all the countries, * and will bring you into your own land.
36:25 And I will pour upon you clean water, and you shall be cleansed from all your filthiness, * and I will cleanse you from all your idols.
36:26 And I will give you a new heart, * and put a new spirit within you: 
36:26 And I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, * and will give you a heart of flesh.
36:27 And I will put my spirit in the midst of you: * and I will cause you to walk in my commandments, and to keep my judgments, and do them.
36:28 And you shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers, * and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
