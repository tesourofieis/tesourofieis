145:2 Praise the Lord, O my soul, in my life I will praise the Lord: * I will sing to my God as long as I shall be.
145:3 Put not your trust in princes: * in the children of men, in whom there is no salvation.
145:4 His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return into his earth: * in that day all their thoughts shall perish.
145:5 Blessed is he who hath the God of Jacob for his helper, whose hope is in the Lord his God: * who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them.
145:7 Who keepeth truth for ever: who executeth judgment for them that suffer wrong: * who giveth food to the hungry.
145:7 The Lord looseth them that are fettered: * the Lord enlighteneth the blind.
145:8 The Lord lifteth up them that are cast down: * the Lord loveth the just.
145:9 The Lord keepeth the strangers, he will support the fatherless and the widow: * and the ways of sinners he will destroy.
145:10 The Lord shall reign for ever: thy God, O Sion, * unto generation and generation.
