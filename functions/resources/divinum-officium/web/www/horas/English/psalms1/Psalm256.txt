(Canticum Ecclesiasticae * Eccli 14:22;15:3-4;15:6)
4:22 Blessed is the man that shall continue in wisdom, and that shall meditate in his justice, * and in his mind shall think of the all-seeing eye of God.
15:3 With the bread of life and understanding, * she shall feed him, and give him the water of wholesome wisdom to drink.
15:4 And she shall be made strong in him, and he shall not be moved: And she shall hold him fast, and he shall not be confounded: * and she shall exalt him among his neighbours.
15:6 And shall cause him to inherit an everlasting name * the Lord our God.
