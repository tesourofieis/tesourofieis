(Canticum Osee * Osea 6:1-6)
6:1 Come, and let us return to the Lord: for he hath taken us, and he will heal us: he will strike, and he will cure us.
6:3 He will revive us after two days: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.
6:3 We shall know, and we shall follow on, that we may know the Lord.
6:3 His going forth is prepared as the morning light, and he will come to us as the early and the latter rain to the earth.
6:4 What shall I do to thee, O Ephraim? what shall I do to thee, O Juda? your mercy is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth away in the morning.
6:5 For this reason have I hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments shall go forth as the light.
6:6 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice: and the knowledge of God more than holocausts.
