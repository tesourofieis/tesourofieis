38:2 I said: I will take heed to my ways: * that I sin not with my tongue.
38:2 I have set guard to my mouth, * when the sinner stood against me.
38:3 I was dumb, and was humbled, and kept silence from good things: * and my sorrow was renewed.
38:4 My heart grew hot within me: * and in my meditation a fire shall flame out.
38:5 I spoke with my tongue: * O Lord, make me know my end.
38:5 And what is the number of my days: * that I may know what is wanting to me.
38:6 Behold thou hast made my days measurable: * and my substance is as nothing before thee.
38:6 And indeed all things are vanity: * every man living.
38:7 Surely man passeth as an image: * yea, and he is disquieted in vain.
38:7 He storeth up: * and he knoweth not for whom he shall gather these things.
38:8 And now what is my hope? Is it not the Lord? * And my substance is with thee.
38:9 Deliver thou me from all my iniquities: * thou hast made me a reproach to the fool.
38:10 I was dumb, and I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done it: * remove thy scourges from me.
38:12 The strength of thy hand hath made me faint in rebukes: * thou hast corrected man for iniquity.
38:12 And thou hast made his soul to waste away like a spider: * surely in vain is any man disquieted.
38:13 Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication: * give ear to my tears.
38:13 Be not silent: for I am a stranger with thee, * and a sojourner as all my fathers were.
38:14 O forgive me, that I may be refreshed, before I go hence, * and be no more.
