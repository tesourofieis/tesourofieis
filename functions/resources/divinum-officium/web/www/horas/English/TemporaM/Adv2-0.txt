[Responsory4]
R. Christ our King cometh.
* And John hath testified of Him, that He is the Lamb that should come!
V. The kings shall shut their mouths at Him, all nations shall serve Him.
R. And John hath testified of Him, that He is the Lamb that should come!

[Lectio8]
In that same Gospel of St Matthew we read: Behold my Son whom I have chosen; my elect in whom my soul is well pleased; I shall place my Spirit over him and he will mete out judgment to the Gentiles. This is to be understood of the Saviour, on whom the Spirit of the Lord rested, that is, remained eternally.

[Responsory8]
R. Behold, the Lord shall come, and all His saints with Him, then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped, then shall the lame man leap as a hart,
* And the tongue of the dumb shall be free.
V. Behold, the Lord shall come with might, and His arm shall rule.
R. And the tongue of the dumb shall be free.
