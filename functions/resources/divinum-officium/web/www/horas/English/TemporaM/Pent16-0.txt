But in all fairness, having thus spoken concerning widows, let us take ourselves again among the married, and join with them in entertaining the opinion which is held by so many, that there are only three classes of men who are shut out from the great supper named in the gospel, which three classes are heathens, Jews, and heretics. And therefore it is that the Apostle warns us that we "walk not as other Gentiles walk," in malice and bitterness, and uncleanness, and covetousness, and so have no entry into the kingdom of Christ, since"no unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ.
