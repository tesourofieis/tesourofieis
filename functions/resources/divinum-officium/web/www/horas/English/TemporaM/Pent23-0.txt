[Lectio12]
"For she said within herself: If I shall touch the hem of his garment I shall be healed." According to the Law anyone who touched a woman having an issue of blood became unclean; this woman therefore touched the Lord that she might be cured of her issue of blood. "Be of good heart, daughter, your faith hath made you whole." He did not say, "Your faith shall make you whole," but rather, "Your faith hath made three whole." For, because you believed in him, you are already whole.
