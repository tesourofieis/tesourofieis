[Lectio4]
From the Sermons of St. Augustine, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!30th on the Saints.
I belive that ye know the history of the sufferings of that most blessed Martyr,~
Lawrence, whose birth-day we are keeping this day, and I doubt not, my beloved~
brethren, but that ye may know what agonies he endured under the persecutors. So~
illustrious is the glory of his martyrdom, that the splendour thereof shineth~
throughout the whole world. And this light, which Lawrence maketh so clearly to~
shine throughout the world, is the light of the fire wherewith he himself was~
enkindled. By the flames which he endured, he hath made hot every Christian~
heart.

[Lectio5]
Who is there but knoweth how that Lawrence chose rather to burn in earthly~
flames for a while, than to suffer the eternal fire of hell? The example,~
therefore, of blessed Lawrence provoketh us to lift up our testimony, kindleth~
our faith, and setteth our love all a-glow. If for us there are now no fires of~
persecution, the flame of faith is not therefore quenched. We give not our~
bodies to be burned for Christ's sake, but our hearts burn with His love. The~
persecutor stirreth up no fire around me, but a fire is stirred up in me by the~
longing for the presence of my Saviour.

[Lectio6]
But that the Saviour hath a fire of His own we read in the Gospel, where the~
Lord saith lam come to send fire on the earth, and what will I but that it be~
kindled? (Luke xii. 49.) It was this fire which had been enkindled in the two~
disciples when they said Did not our heart burn within us, while He talked~
with us by the way, and while He opened to us the Scriptures? (Luke xxiv. 32.)~
It was because this fire had been enkindled within him that the blessed Lawrence~
felt not the burning of the flames, and through eager yearning for the sight of~
Christ perceived not the cruelty of his persecutor.

[Lectio7]
From the Holy Gospel according to John
!John 12:25-27
At that time Jesus said unto His disciples Amen, Amen I say unto you, Except a~
corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone. And so on.

Homily by St. Augustine, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!51st Tract on John.
When matters are come to this pass that a simple choice must be made, either to~
break the law of God, or to bid farewell to this life; when a man must needs~
choose one or the other alternative, and the persecutor is threatening him with~
death, then let him choose rather to honour God and die, than to insult Him and~
live. This choice will be to hate his life in this world and to keep it unto~
life eternal. If any man serve Me, let him follow Me. And what is it to follow~
Christ but to imitate Him? Christ, saith the Apostle Peter, suffered for us,~
leaving us an example, that we should follow His steps. (I. ii. 21.)

[Lectio8]
Behold what is said If any man serve Me, let him follow Me. Follow Him, and~
with what result? at what wage? for what reward? And, saith the Lord, where I am,~
there shall also My servant be. He must be loved for Himself alone, if the wage~
of working in His service be to be with Him. Where would it be well where He was~
not? Or where could it be ill where He was? Hear even more clearly If any man~
serve Me, him will My Father honour. With what honour will He honour him, but to~
put him to be with His Own Son? That which is said first Where I am there~
shall also My servant be is explained by the next words Him will My Father~
honour. What higher honour can an adopted son receive, than to be where the~
Only-Begotten Son is, not in equality of Divine nature, but linked in eternal~
fellowship?
