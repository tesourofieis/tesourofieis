[Oratio]
O God, Who wast pleased that the blessed Mary always a Virgin, being herself the~
dwelling-place of the Holy Ghost, should, as on this day, be presented in thine~
earthly Temple, grant, we beseech thee, that by her prayers we may worthily be~
presented in the heavenly Temple of thy glory.
$Per Dominum eiusdem

[Lectio4]
From the Book Upon the Orthodox Faith, written by St. John of Damascus
!Bk. iv, chap. 15
Joachim took to wife that most eminent and praiseworthy woman, Anne. And even as~
the ancient Hannah, being stricken with barrenness, by prayer and promise became~
the mother of Samuel, so likewise this woman also through prayer and promise~
received from God the Mother of God, that in fruitfulness she might not be~
behind any of the famous matrons. And thus grace (for such is the signification~
of the name of Anne) is mother of the Lady (for such is the signification of the~
name of Mary.) And indeed she became the Lady of every creature, since she hath~
been mother of the Creator. She first saw the light in Joachim's house, hard by~
the Pool of Bethesda, at Jerusalem, and was carried to the Temple. There planted~
in the Lord, the dew of His Spirit made her to flourish in the courts of her God,~
and like a green olive she became a tree, so that all the doves of grace came~
and lodged in her branches. And so she raised her mind utterly above the lust of~
life and the lust of the flesh, and kept her soul virgin in her virgin body, as~
became her that was to receive God into her womb.

[Lectio5]
From the Book Upon Virgins, written by St. Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!ii
Such was Mary that her single life offereth an example to all. If then the doer~
displease us not, let us applaud the deed; if any other woman seek like reward,~
let her follow after like works. In the one Virgin how many glorious examples do~
shine forth. Her's was the hidden treasure of modesty, her's the high standard~
of faith, her's the self-sacrifice of earnestness, her's to be the pattern of~
maidenhood at home, of kinswomanhood in ministry, of motherhood in the Temple. O~
to how many virgins hath she been helpful, how many hath she taken in her arms~
and presented unto the Lord, saying Here is one who, (like me,) hath kept~
stainlessly clean the wedding -chamber, the marriage -bed of my Son!

[Lectio6]
Why should I go on to speak of the scantiness of her eating, or of the~
multiplicity of her work? how her labour seemed above human capacity, and her~
refreshment insufficient for human strength, her toil never missing a moment,~
her fasting taking two days together. And when she was fain to eat, she took not~
dainties, but whatsoever food came first to hand that would keep body and soul~
together. She would not sleep till need was, and even then, while her body~
rested, her soul watched, for she often talked in her sleep, either repeating~
things that she had read, or going on with what she was doing before sleep~
interrupted her, or rehearsing things executed, or talking of things projected.
