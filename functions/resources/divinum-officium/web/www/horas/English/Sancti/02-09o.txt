[Oratio]
O God, Who, amidst the wondrous work of thy Divine power, dost make even weak~
women to be more than conquerors in the uplifting of their testimony, mercifully~
grant unto all us which do keep the Birthday of thy blessed handmaiden and~
witness Apollonia grace to follow her steps toward thee.
