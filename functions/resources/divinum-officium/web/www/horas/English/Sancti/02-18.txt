[Lectio93]
Simeon, the son of Cleophas, (Matth. xiii. 55,) was chosen the second Bishop~
of Jerusalem, (in the year 62,) being the first after James. Under the Emperor~
Trajan he was accused before the Pro-Consul Atticus, as being both a Christian~
and a relation of Christ, this being the time when all were arrested that were~
of the lineage of David. He underwent with great suffering the same things that~
were inflicted on our Saviour, and all men marvelled to see with how great~
boldness and firmness he endured the grievous torment of the cross, at his great~
age, for he was an hundred and twenty years old. (a.d. 107 or 116.)
