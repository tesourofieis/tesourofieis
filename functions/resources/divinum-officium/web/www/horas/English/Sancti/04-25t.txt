R. Open thine eyes, and behold our desolation.

* She hath none to comfort her, save thee, O our God
V. She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks.
R. She hath none to comfort her, save thee, O our God

[Lectio4]
From the Book upon Church Writers, composed by St. Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.
_
Mark was the disciple and interpreter of Peter, and it was from what he had heard' Peter tell, that, at the request of the brethren at Rome, he wrote the shortest of the Gospels. When Peter had heard it, he approved it, and gave it to the Church to be read, by his authority. Mark betook himself to Egypt, with the Gospel which he had compiled, and was the first man who preached Christ at Alexandria. There he founded a Church with such teaching and austerity of life, that all who followed Christ were constrained to imitate him. ~
Last of all, Philo, that most learned Jew, observing that the first Church of Alexandria still kept the law of Moses, wrote a book concerning their manners, as if in praise of his own nation, wherein he saith that under the teaching of Mark, the Christians of Alexandria had all things in common, just as Luke telleth us was the case with all them that believed at Jerusalem. Mark died in the eighth year of Nero, and was buried at Alexandria. Anianus succeeded him.
