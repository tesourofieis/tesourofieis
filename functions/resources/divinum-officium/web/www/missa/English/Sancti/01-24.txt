Lesson from the first letter of St. Paul the Apostle to Timothy
!1 Tim. 6:11-16
Beloved: Pursue justice, godliness, faith, charity, patience, mildness. Fight the good fight of the faith, lay hold on the life eternal, to which you have been called, and have made the good confession before may witnesses. I charge you in the sight of God, Who gives life to all things, and in the sight of Christ Jesus, Who bore witness before Pontius Pilate to the good confession, that you keep the commandment without stain, blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. This coming He in His own time will make manifest, Who is the Blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords; Who alone has immortality and dwells in light inaccessible, Whom no man has seen or can see, to Whom be honor and everlasting dominion. Amen.
