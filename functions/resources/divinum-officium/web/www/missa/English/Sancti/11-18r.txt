[Oratio]
O God, Who for us bring each year the recurrence of the consecration day of this~
Your holy temple, and always bring us back safely to the sacred rites, hear the~
prayers of Your people and grant that whoever enters this temple to pray for~
blessings, may rejoice in having obtained whatever he sought.

[Postcommunio]
!On the anniversary of the dedication
O God, Who from living and chosen stones prepare an eternal dwelling place for~
Your Majesty, help Your people who call upon You, so that whatever benefits come~
to Your Church materially may be even greater through its spiritual extension.
