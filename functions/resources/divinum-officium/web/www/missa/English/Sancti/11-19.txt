glorious prayers of blessed Elizabeth, make us look upon worldly prosperity as~
nought, and ever rejoice in heavenly consolation.

O Lord, may the offerings of Your devoted people be pleasing to You in honor of~
Your saints, through whose merits they know they have received help in time of~
trial.

[Postcommunio]
You have filled Your people, O Lord, with sacred gifts; ever comfort us, we~
beseech You, by the intercession of her whose festival we are celebrating.
