[Oratio]
O God, Who taught blessed Hedwig to forsake worldly vanities that she might with~
her whole heart humbly follow Your cross, grant that, through her merits and~
example, we may learn to renounce the perishable delights of the world and, by~
embracing Your cross, overcome all things opposed to us.
$Qui vivis

[Secreta]
O Lord, may the offerings of Your devoted people be pleasing to You in honor of~
Your saints, through whose merits they know they have received help in time of~
trial.
$Per Dominum

[Postcommunio]
You have filled Your people, O Lord, with sacred gifts; ever comfort us, we~
beseech You, by the intercession of her whose festival we are celebrating.
