[Lectio]
Lesson from the first letter of St. Peter the Apostle
!1 Pet 1:1-7
v. Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers dispersed through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, elect, According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, unto the sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you and peace be multiplied. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that can not fade, reserved in heaven for you, Who, by the power of God, are kept by faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. Wherein you shall greatly rejoice, if now you must be for a little time made sorrowful in divers temptations: That the trial of your faith (much more precious than gold which is tried by the fire) may be found unto praise and glory and honour at the appearing of Jesus Christ.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 16:13-19
v. At that time, Jesus,~
having come into the district of Cesarea Philippi,~
began to ask His disciples, saying, "Who do men~
say the Son of Man is?" But they said, "Some say,~
John the Baptist; and others, Elias; and others,~
Jeremias, or one of the prophets." He said to them,~
'But who do you say that I am?" Simon Peter~
answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son~
of the living God." Then Jesus answered and said,~
"Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jona, for flesh and~
blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father~
in heaven" And I say to you, you are Peter, and~
upon this rock I will build My Church, and the~
gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will~
give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and~
whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound~
in heaven, and whatever you shall loose on earth~
shall be loosed in heaven."
