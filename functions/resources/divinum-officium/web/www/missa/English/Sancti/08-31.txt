[Oratio]
O God, Who made blessed Raymund, Your Confessor, famous for delivering Your~
faithful from the captivity of the infidels, grant us by his intercession that,~
having been released from the bonds of our sins, we may with free minds do what~
is pleasing to You.
$Per Dominum

[Secreta]
We offer You sacrifices of praise, O Lord, in memory of Your Saints; trusting~
that by them we may be delivered from both present and future evils.
$Per Dominum

[Postcommunio]
Refreshed with heavenly food and drink, we humbly pray You, our God, that we~
also may be helped by his prayers in memory of whom we have partaken of these~
gifts.
