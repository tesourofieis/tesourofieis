[Oratio]
Almighty and merciful God, Who endowed St. Jane Frances, burning with love of~
You, with a wondrous strength of spirit through all the paths of life in the way~
of perfection, and willed through her to ennoble Your Church by a new religious~
family; grant by her merits and prayers, that we who are aware of our weakness,~
may trust firmly in Your power and, by the assistance of divine grace, overcome~
all obstacles in our way.
$Per Dominum

[Commemoratio Oratio]
!Infra Octavam Assumptionis
O Lord, we beseech thee, forgive the transgressions of thy servants, and, forasmuch as by our own deeds we cannot please thee, may we find safety through the prayers of the Mother of thy Son and our Lord.
$Qui tecum.



[Secreta]
O Lord, may this sacrificial gift enkindle in us that fire of love which burned~
so warmly in the heart of St. Jane Frances and consumed it by the flames of~
everlasting charity.
$Per Dominum

[Commemoratio Secreta]
!Infra Octavam Assumptionis
May the prayer of the Mother of God aid Thy people, O Lord: and although w√© know, her, to have passed out of this life, fulfilling the lot of the flesh, may we experience her intercession for us with Thee in Heavenly glory. 
$Per eundem

[Postcommunio]
Pour upon us, O Lord, the spirit of Your love, that You Who have filled us with~
the strength of heavenly bread, may through the intercession of blessed Jane~
Frances, make us look upon the things of the world as nought and with pure minds~
seek You, the only God.
$Per Dominum

[Commemoratio Postcommunio]
!Infra Octavam Assumptionis
We who have been made partakers of Thy heavenly table, implore Thy mercy, O Lord our God, that as we celebrate the Assumption of the Mother of God, we may through her inyercesion, be delivered from all evils that beset us.
