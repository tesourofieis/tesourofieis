[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Mark
!Mark 11:22-24
At that time, Jesus answered and said to His disciples, Have faith in God. Amen I~
say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Arise, and hurl yourself into the~
sea,’ and does not waver in his heart, but believes that whatever he says will~
be done, it shall be done for him. Therefore I say to you, all things whatever~
you ask for in prayer, believe that you shall receive, and they shall come to~
you.
