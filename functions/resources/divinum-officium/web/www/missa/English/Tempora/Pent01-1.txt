[Oratio]
O God, the Strength of all them that put their trust in thee, mercifully accept~
our prayers, and because through the weakness of our mortal nature we can do no~
good thing without thee, grant us the help of thy grace, that in keeping of thy~
commandments we may please thee, both in will and deed.
$Per Dominum

[Secreta]
Be appeased, O Lord, we beseech thee, and accept the victims we dedicate to thee,~
and grant that they may avail us for perpetual aid.
$Per Dominum

[Postcommunio]
Filled, O Lord, as we are with so great bounties, we beseech thee; that we may~
receive the gifts of salvation, and never cease from thy praise.
