Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 20:1-9
Azon időben a hét első napján, reggel, amikor még sötét volt, Mária Magdolna kiment a sírhoz. És így tovább.
_
Homily by Pope St Gregory (the Great.)
!22nd on the Gospels.
Dearly beloved brethren, the portion of the Holy Gospel which hath just now been read in your ears, is exceeding simple on the face of it, which is its historical sense; but the mystic almighty and everlasting God, Who hast made the Mystery of the Passover the seal of the Covenant of man's Redemption, grant unto our souls that we may not only outwardly observe the same, but may effectually bring forth the fruits thereof. Through our Lord Jesus Christ thy Son, Who liveth sense, which underlieth that other, requireth from us a little searching. Mary Magdalene came unto the Sepulchre when it was yet dark. The historic sense telleth us what was the hour of day; the mystic sense, the state of her understanding who sought. Mary Magdalene sought for Him, by Whom all things were made, and Whom she had seen die, as concerning the flesh; she sought for Him, I say, in the grave, and finding Him not, she believed that He had been stolen away. Yea, it was yet dark, when she came unto the sepulchre. Then she ran and told the disciples, but they who had loved Him most, namely Peter and John, did outrun the others.
