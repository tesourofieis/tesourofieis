Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 6:24-33
Azon idoben így szólt Jézus tanítványaihoz: Senki sem szolgálhat két úrnak. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop of Hippo.
!Bk. ii. on the Lord's Sermon on the Mount, ch. xiv.
No man can serve two masters, and this is further explained for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise~
the other. These words we ought carefully to weigh, for the Lord showeth straightway who be the two masters whom we have choice of: Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. Mammon is a term which the Hebrews are said to use for riches. It is also a Carthaginian word for the Punic for gain is mammon. He which serveth mammon, serveth that evil one who hath perversely chosen to be lord of these earthly things, and is called by the Lord the prince of this world. (John xiv. 30.) Of these two masters, either a man will hate the one and love the other,~
that is God or he will hold to the one and despise the other. He which serveth mammon holdeth to an hard and destroying master, for he is led captive by his lust, and sold a slave to the devil, and him loveth no man is there any man that loveth the devil And yet there be that hold to him.
