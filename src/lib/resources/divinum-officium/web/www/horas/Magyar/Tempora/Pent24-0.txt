Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 24:15-35
Amikor majd látjátok a szent helyen az iszonyatos pusztulást, amelyet Dániel~
próféta megjövendölt - aki olvassa, értse meg! És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest (at Bethlehem.)
!Bk. iv. Comm. on Matth. xxiv.
This injunction to whoso readeth, to understand, showeth that there is here~
something mysterious. In Daniel we read as followeth " And in the midst of the~
week the sacrifice and the oblations shall be taken away and in the temple there~
shall be the abomination of desolation, even until the consummation of the time~
and a consummation shall be given to the desolation." (ix. 27.) It is of this~
same thing that the Apostle speaketh, when he saith that a man of iniquity, even~
an adversary, shall be exalted against whatsoever is called God, or is~
worshipped so that he shall even dare to stand in the temple of God, and to show~
himself as God whose coming shall, according to the working of Satan, destroy~
and banish away from God all who shall receive him.
