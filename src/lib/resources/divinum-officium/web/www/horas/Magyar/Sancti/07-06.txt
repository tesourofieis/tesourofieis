Evangélium szent Máté Apostol kőnyvéből
!Matt 14:22-23
Azon időben Jézus szólt a tanítványoknak, szálljanak bárkába, és evezzenek át a~
túlsó partra, addig ő hazaküldi a népet. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Jerome, Priest at Bethlehem.
!Bk. ii. Comm. on Matth. xiv.
The Lord commanded His disciples to cross over to the other side, and~
constrained them to get into a ship. By these expressions we perceive that they~
were unwilling to leave the Lord, the love of their Teacher making them desire~
not to lose a moment of His company. And when He had sent the multitudes away,~
He went up into a mountain apart to pray. Perchance, if Peter, and James, and~
John, who had seen Him in the glory of the Transfiguration, had been with Him,~
they would have gone up into the mountain with Him, but the common herd could~
not follow Him, save when He taught them on the sea shore, or fed them in the~
wilderness.
