Evangélium szent János könyvéből
!John 8:1-11
Azon időben Jézus kiment az Olajfák hegyére, majd kora reggel újra megjelent a templomban. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!33rd Tract on John.
Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives  even unto that fruitful Mount, that~
anointing Mount, that Mount of Chrism. Where else became it Christ to teach if~
not on the Mount of Olives? For the word Christ is derived from Chrisma, and~
Chrisma is the Greek for ointment. He hath anointed us that we may be able to~
wrestle with the devil. And, early in the morning, He came again into the~
temple; and all the people came unto Him; and He sat down, and taught them  and~
no man laid hands on Him, because He was not yet pleased to suffer. And now~
listen how His enemies tried the Lord's meekness.
