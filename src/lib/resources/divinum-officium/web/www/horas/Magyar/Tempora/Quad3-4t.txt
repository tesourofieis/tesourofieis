Evangélium szent Lukács Evangélista kőnyvéből
!Luke 4:38-44
Azon időben Jézus a zsinagógából kijőve, Simon házába ment. Simon anyósa magas lázban feküdt. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. iv. on Luke iv.
Behold here how long-suffering is the Lord our Redeemer! Neither moved to anger~
against them, nor sickened at their guilt, nor outraged by their attacks, did He~
leave the Jews' country. Nay, forgetting their iniquity, and mindful only of His~
mercy, He strove to soften their hard and unbelieving hearts, sometimes by His~
teaching, and sometimes by freeing some of them, and sometimes by healing them.~
St Luke doth well to tell us first of the man who was delivered from an unclean~
spirit, and then of the healing of a woman. The Lord indeed came to heal both~
sexes, but that must be healed first which was created first, and then must not~
she be passed by whose first sin arose rather from fickleness of heart than from~
depraved will.
