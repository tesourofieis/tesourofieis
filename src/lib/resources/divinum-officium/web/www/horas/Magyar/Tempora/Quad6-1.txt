Evangélium szent János könyvéből
!John 12:1-9.
Hat nappal húsvét előtt Jézus Betániába ment, ahol Lázár lakott, akit feltámasztott a halálból. Ott vacsorát rendeztek neki. Márta felszolgált és Lázár is a vendégek közt volt. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!50th Tract on John.
 There they made Him a supper and Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table~
lest men should deem that it was but by an ocular delusion that they had seen~
him arise from the dead. He lived therefore, spake, and ate; to the~
manifestation of the truth, and the confusion of the unbelieving Jews. Jesus,~
then, sat down to meat with Lazarus and others, and Martha, being one of~
Lazarus' sisters, served. But Mary, Lazarus' other sister, took a pound of~
ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the Feet of Jesus, and wiped~
His Feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.~
We have now heard that which was done; let us search out the mystic meaning~
thereof.
