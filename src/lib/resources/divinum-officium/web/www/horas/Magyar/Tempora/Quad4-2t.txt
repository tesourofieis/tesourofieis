Evangélium szent János Apostol kőnyvéből
!John 7:14-31
Azon időben amikor már eltelt az ünnep fele, Jézus fölment a templomba, és tanított. A zsidók csodálkoztak És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!29th Tract on John.
He Who had gone up unto the Feast, not openly, but as it were in secret, the~
Same taught, and spake openly, and no man laid hands upon Him. That He had hid~
Himself, was for example's sake; that He manifested Himself, was to show His~
power. And when He taught, the Jews marvelled. As seemeth to my I mind, they all~
marvelled, but were not all converted. And wherefore marvelled they? Because~
many of them knew where He was born, and how He had been brought up. They had~
never seen Him learn letters; but they heard Him dispute concerning the law, and~
alledge the testimony of the same, as no man could do who had not read it; and~
no man can read unless he learn; and therefore they marvelled. But their~
marvelling was unto the Teacher an occasion for the revealing of higher truth.
