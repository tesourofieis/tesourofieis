Evangélium szent Lukács könyvéből
!Luke 7:11-16
Azon időben Jézus Naim városába ment. Vele tartottak tanítványai és mások is~
igen sokan. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Ambrose, Bishop (of Milan.)
!Bk. v. Conwi. on Luke vii.
The history which we here read in the Holy Gospel hath for us specially two~
gracious lessons, the one from the literal, the other from the mystic~
interpretation thereof. According to the letter then, we see how quickly the~
compassion of God was aroused by the sorrow of this mother, who was a widow, a~
widow broken down by nursing her only son, or by the bitterness of her grief for~
his death. She was a widow also whose worshipful conversation is borne witness~
to by this, that, much people of the city was with her. Mystically however, this~
widow encompassed by the multitude was something more than a poor woman whose~
tears won from the Lord the resurrection of her young and only son; for she is a~
type of our holy Mother the Church, who calleth back her young children to life~
from the pursuit of deathly vanities, and soul-slaying honours, by bidding them~
look on those tears which she sheddeth for such as they, and which it is~
unlawful for her to shed for them of whom she knoweth that they will rise again.
