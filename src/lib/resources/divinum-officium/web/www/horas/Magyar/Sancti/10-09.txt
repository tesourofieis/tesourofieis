@Commune/C3:Oratio proper
$Oremus
O God, Who, as upon this day, didst make thy blessed Witness and Bishop Denys~
strong to wrestle and to suffer, and Who wast pleased to give unto him, for~
fellow workers in declaring thy glory among the heathen, thy servants Rusticus~
and Eleutherius, grant unto us, we beseech thee, to be like unto them in~
esteeming the good things of this world but lightly, and in fearing not at all~
the evil things of the same.
$Per Dominum
