The brethren Cyril and Methodius were born in an honourable position at~
Thessalonica. As they advanced in years they went to Constantinople to study~
letters in the capital of the Eastern world. Both made quick progress, but most~
chiefly Cyril, who gained such learning that he was called for excellency the~
Philosopher. Methodius became a monk, but the Empress Theodora, on the~
recommendation of the Patriarch Ignatius, deemed Cyril worthy of receiving the~
task of teaching Christianity to the Khazar who dwelt beyond the Crimea. By the~
grace of God he so taught them that they laid aside their many superstitions and~
were joined to Jesus Christ. After properly establishing the new community of~
Christians Cyril hastened back to Constantinople, where he entered the~
monastery of Polychron, whither Methodius had already withdrawn himself.~
Rastilaw, Prince of Moravia, having heard tell of the good deeds beyond the~
Crimea, sent to Constantinople to the Emperor Michael III. to obtain some Gospel~
labourers. Cyril and Methodius were sent to him, and gladly received in Moravia,~
and applied themselves with such power and industry to the work of~
Christianising souls that it was not long before that nation also joyfully~
submitted to Jesus Christ. To this end Cyril found of great use the knowledge of~
the Slavonic language, which he had already acquired, and much effect was~
produced by the translation of holy Scripture which he made into the language of~
the people. Cyril and Methodius were the inventors of the alphabet in which the~
language of the Slavs is characteristically expressed, and for this reason they~
have been not unjustly termed the fathers of Slavonic literature.
