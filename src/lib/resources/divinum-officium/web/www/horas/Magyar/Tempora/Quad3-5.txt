Evangélium szent János könyvéből
!John 4:5-42
Azon időben odaért Szamaria egyik városához, Szikarhoz, ez annak a földnek a közelében volt, amelyet Jákob fiának, Józsefnek adott. És így tovább.
_
Homily by St Austin, Bishop (of Hippo.)
!15th Tract on John.
Jesus, wearied with His journey, Jesus, wearied with His journey, the mysteries~
are beginning now. It is not for nothing that Jesus is wearied. It is not for~
nothing that the Mighty One of God is wearied. It is not for nothing that He is~
wearied Who Himself giveth Rest to all them that are weary and heavy-laden. It~
is not for nothing that He is wearied Whose absence prostrateth us, and Whose~
presence maketh us to be strong.
