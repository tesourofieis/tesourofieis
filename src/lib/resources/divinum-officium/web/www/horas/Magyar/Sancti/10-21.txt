Grant unto us, we beseech thee, O Lord, our God, that we may ever call to mind,~
with all worship and thanksgiving, the victory of thy holy Virgin Martyrs Ursula~
and companions, and although we know that our mind cannot comprehend thee Who~
art this day their exceeding great reward, give us always the grace humbly to~
worship thee.
