[Oratio]
Gud, du alle gode gavers giver, du, som i din tjenerinde Bibiana har forbundet martyrdommens palme med jomfruelighedens blomst, forbind ved hendes forboen vore hjerter i kaerlighed med dig, for at vi efter at have undgaaet alle farer maa opnaa de evige beloenninger.

[Lectio4]
Bibiana was a Roman maiden, distinguished on account of the nobility of her~
family, but now far more distinguished for her confession of Christ. In the~
reign of the foul tyrant, Julian the Apostate, her father Flavian, although he~
was an ex-Praefect, was branded as a slave and banished to Acquapendente, not~
far from Rome, where he soon died a martyr for his faith. His wife, Dafrosa, and~
his two daughters, Bibiana and Demetria, were first imprisoned in their own~
house, with the idea of starving them to death; but the mother was afterwards~
taken outside the city and beheaded. Bibiana and her sister Demetria, after the~
death of their holy parents, were stripped of all they had in the world.~
Apronianus, Praetor of the city, who hankered after their property, continued to~
persecute them, but although they were destitute of all human support, God, Who~
giveth bread to the hungry, fed them, and kept them in health, life, and~
strength, to the wonder of their enemies.

[Lectio5]
Apronianus then attacked them, to make them worship the gods of the Gentiles,~
and promised them the restoration of their property, the favour of the Emperor,~
and a great marriage for each of them, if they would give way, and, on the other~
hand, imprisonment, stripes, and death. But neither promises nor threats availed,~
for they remained firm in the faith, being resolved rather to die than to~
pollute themselves by doing according to the deeds of the heathen; and, as for~
the iniquity of the Praetor, they loathed it continually. At length the strength~
of Demetria gave way, and she fell down suddenly, and died in the Lord, before~
the eyes of her sister Bibiana. Then Bibiana was put into the hands of an artful~
woman named Rufina, to seduce her if possible; but she had known the law of~
Christ from her childhood, and kept the lily of her purity undefiled, triumphing~
over the efforts of that vile person, and disappointing the lust of the Praetor.

[Lectio6]
Then, when Rufina saw that her false words availed not, she took to blows, and~
scourged Bibiana daily, but the saint was not staggered in her holy resolution.~
At last the Praetor, mad with baffled lust, when he found his labour was thrown~
away, ordered his lictors to strip her naked, hang her up by the hands to a~
pillar, and flog her to death with whips weighted with lead. When all was over,~
her sacred body was thrown out for the dogs to eat. It lay two days in the Forum~
Tauri, but the animals would not touch it; and, at last, a Priest, named John,~
took it, and buried it by night beside the graves of her mother and sister, near~
the Licinian Palace. This is the place where there is still a church, dedicated~
in the name of St. Bibiana. When this church was being restored by Urban VIII.,~
the bodies of these three holy women, Bibiana, Demetria, and Dafrosa, were found,~
and were re-buried under the High Altar.

[Lectio94]
Bibiana, en romersk jomfru, blev født af ædle forældre, men var af stadig ædlere race på grund af sin kristne tro. Hendes forældre, Flavian og Dafrosa, led martyrdøden under Julian den Frafaldne. Så blev Bibiana og hendes søster, Demetria, frataget alle deres ejendele, og Apronianus, byens prætor, forsøgte, både ved løfter og ved trusler, at få dem til at opgive den sande tro. Men de modstod ham og hans ondskab med stor standhaftighed. I denne kamp kollapsede Demetria pludselig for Bibianas øjne og døde i Herren. Dernæst blev Bibiana selv udleveret til en meget listig kvinde ved navn Rufina, som skulle forfoere hende. Men Bibiana sejrede over alle hendes lister og forpurrede prætorens onde planer. Så befalede han, at hun skulle slås med blyholdige piske, og til sidst opgav hun sin aanden. Hendes hellige legeme, efterladt udsat for hundene i to dage, blev bevaret uskadt ved guddommelig kraft. Præsten Johannes begravede det om natten ved siden af hendes søsters og mors grav, nær Licinius-paladset, hvor der nu står en kirke dedikeret til Gud og opkaldt efter d. hl. Bibiana.
