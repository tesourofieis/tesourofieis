[Ant 1]
The blessed Agnes stood in the midst of the fire * and stretched forth her hands~
unto the Lord, and prayed, saying O Thou Who Alone art Almighty! Who Alone art~
to be adored! Who Alone art to be worshipped! Who Alone art to be feared! I~
bless thee, and glorify thy Name for ever and ever!

[Oratio]
O God, Who year by year dost gladden thy people by the solemn feast of thy~
blessed Virgin and Martyr Agnes, grant unto us, we beseech thee, not only~
devoutly to observe the same, but also to follow after the pattern of her godly~
conversation.
