7 The channel of the river shall be laid bare from its fountain, and every thing sown by the water shall be dried up, it shall wither away, and shall be no more.
8 The fishers also shall mourn, and all that cast a hook into the river shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish away.
9 They shall be confounded that wrought in flax, combing and weaving fine linen.
10 And its watery places shall be dry, all they shall mourn that made pools to take fishes.

14 The Lord hath mingled in the midst thereof the spirit of giddiness: and they have caused Egypt to err in all its works, as a drunken man staggereth and vomiteth.
15 And there shall be no work for Egypt, to make head or tail, him that bendeth down, or that holdeth back.
