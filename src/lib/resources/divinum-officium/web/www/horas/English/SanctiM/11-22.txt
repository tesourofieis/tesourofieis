[Ant Matutinum]
The Maiden Cecily overcame Almachius, and called Tiburtius and Valerian to crowns;;8
She spread forth her hands and prayed unto the Lord, that He would deliver her from her enemies;;18
Cecily brought under her body with haircloth, and besought God with loud crying;;23
O Lord Jesus Christ, Who hast said of abstaining from marriage, He that is able to receive it, let him receive it, accept now the fruits from this seed, which Thou didst sow in the heart of Cecily;;44
Blessed Cecily said unto Tiburtius To-day I call thee my brother, for the love of God hath made thee to cast away idols;;45
Lord, let my heart and my body be undefiled, that I be not ashamed;;47
V. In thy comeliness and thy beauty
R. Go forward, fare prosperously, and reign.
Cecilia * me misit ad vos, ut ostendatis mihi sanctum Urbanum; quia ad ipsum habeo secreta, quae perferam.;;84
Triduanas * a Domino poposci inducias, ut domum meum Ecclesiam consecrarem.;;86
Christ, the Son of God, Who hath chosen unto Himself such an handmaiden, Him we believe to be the true God;;95
We that have known His Holy Name can by no means deny Him;;96
Then Valerian went his way, and found the holy Urban, by the sign which had been given him;;97
Accinxcit * fortitudine lumnos suos, et roboravit brachium suum; ideoque lucerna eius non exstinguetur in sempiternum.;;98
V. God shall help her with His countenance.
R. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved.
Virgo gloriosa * semper Evangelium Christi gerebat in pectore suo, et non diebus neque noctibus, a colloquiis divinis et oratione cessabat.;;249;250;251
V. God hath chosen her, and fore-chosen her.
R. He hath made her to dwell in His tabernacle.
