(Canticum Isaiae * Isa 66:10-16)
66:10 Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, * all you that love her:
66:10 Rejoice for joy with her, all you that mourn for her. * That you may suck, and be filled with the breasts of her consolations:
66:11 That you may milk out, and flow with delights, * from the abundance of her glory.
66:12 For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring upon her as it were a river of peace, * and as an overflowing torrent the glory of the Gentiles,
66:12 Which you shall suck; you shall be carried at the breasts, * end upon the knees they shall caress you.
66:13 As one whom the mother caresseth, so will I comfort you, * and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
66:14 You shall see and your heart shall rejoice, * and your bones shall flourish like an herb,
66:14 And the hand of the Lord shall be known to his servants, * and he shall be angry with his enemies.
66:15 For behold the Lord will come with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind, * to render his wrath in indignation, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
66:16 For the Lord shall judge by fire, and by his sword unto all flesh, * and the slain of the Lord shall be many.
