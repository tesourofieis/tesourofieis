(Canticum Sapientiae * Sap 10:17-21)
10:17 And God rendered to the just the wages of their labours, * and conducted them in a wonderful way:
10:17 And he was to them for a covert by day, * and for the light of stars by night:
10:18 And he brought them through the Red Sea, * and carried them over through a great water.
10:19 But their enemies he drowned in the sea, * and from the depth of hell he brought them out.
10:20 Therefore the just took the spoils of the wicked, * and they sung to your holy name, O Lord,
10:21 And they praised with one accord your victorious hand, for wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb, * and made the tongues of infants eloquent.
