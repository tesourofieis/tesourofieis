[Oratio]
O Lord Jesus Christ, who, to win souls for yourself, led your holy virgin Frances, burning with love for your most Sacred Heart, on many journeys throughout the world, and through her raised up a new family of Virgins within your Church, grant, we beseech you, that by her intercession we may put on the virtues of that same Heart and be found worthy to reach the eternal haven of happiness.
$Qui vivis

[Hymnus Matutinum]
v. From the heart of Jesus flames so strong,
Impel Christ's messenger, God-speed, along,
Ever so faithful to the call from on high,
To farthermost regions she hurriedly draws nigh.
_
She, wheresoe'er her footsteps tread,
The fragrance of lilies was sure to be spread,
O'ergrown with briars the earth's dreadful scene,
Her touch transforms to a smiling field green.
_
Emigrants from Italy far from home,
Scattered through all climes and left to roam,
See in her deeds a mother so dear
Eager to lighten life's burdens here.
_
This valiant woman nothing could stay,
Regions e'er so torrid could not hinder her way,
Neither the billows of the great raging deep,
Nor the snow-capped peaks ever so steep.
_
To God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, Three in One,
Laud, honor, might and glory be
From age to age eternally.
Amen.

[Lectio94]
Frances Xavier, born in the town of Sant'Angelo in the diocese of Lodi, from her earliest years dedicated her life to God. When she was thirteen years old, she vowed virginity to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus. She then taught at Lodi and thereafter the Bishop appointed her directress of an orphanage and also urged her to found a new religious congregation which would be devoted to the missions. And so, when she was thirty years old, in the chapel of Our Lady of Grace at Codogno, she laid the foundation of the Institute of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart. She was uncertain where to undertake missionary work, but when Leo XIII told her to go West she recognized in his word the will of God. She traveled across the ocean twenty-four times and earned the title of mother of the Italians in North America. Her mind and heart were in constant union with God in whom her confidence was implicit. She hailed the Blessed Virgin Mary as the Mother of her Congregation. She affected the wonderful spread of her Institute as is evidenced from the fact that she established sixty-seven houses. Finally, her life came to an end at Chicago on December 22, 1917, and her remains were translated to New York. She was beatified by Pius XI, whereas Pius XII added her name to the list of holy Virgins.

[Hymnus Laudes]
v. Jesus' love divine, theme worthy of all song,
To whom alone high deeds belong,
Causing e'en virgins on missions to go,
Their hearts all burning with th'apostles glow.
_
Through thee the renown of Frances did shine,
Despising the world in thy love to recline,
Transcending her sex, yea knowing no bound,
She extended God's glory all the world round.
_
O Blessed Mother from heaven above,
Regard here thy daughters with kindliest love,
Make flourish now thy good work below,
That virtue's blossoms we ever may know.
_
The heart of Jesus, we pray thee, sway,
For one flock 'mong nations, may he hasten the day,
And mindful of us, do thou obtain,
Like flames of love we may attain.
_
To God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, Three in One,
Laud, honor, might and glory be
From age to age eternally.
Amen.

[Hymnus Vespera]
v. Let the court of the blessed in heaven resound
With joyful melody all the year round,
Let the earth in subjection add its applause
From pole to pole in heaven's great cause.
_
Now Frances in triumph with the heavenly company,
In a nimbus of glory with joy for eternity,
Xavier as a model she ever revered,
Faithful in his footsteps she always adhered.
_
When but a child of tenderest age
With love for Jesus, burning so sage
In her breast she ponders being led to pine,
That all nations be brought to her love divine.
_
Lo! The voice of God disturbs her rest,
The dove must leave her homeland nest,
Again and again she wings her long flight
To world's farthest ends unperturbed by fright.
_
To God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, Three in One,
Laud, honor, might and glory be
From age to age eternally.
Amen.
