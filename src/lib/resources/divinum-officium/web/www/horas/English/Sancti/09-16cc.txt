v. Be ready, O Lord, to listen unto our joyful prayers, and grant that as we do~
year by year in love and earnestness recall the day whereon thy blessed~
witnesses Euphemia, Lucy, and Geminian suffered for thy sake, so we may also~
have the grace to imitate the firmness of their faith.

[Lectio93]
Euphemia, Lucy, and Geminian were all crowned with Martyrdom in the persecution~
under Diocletian, upon the same day, though not in the same place. Euphemia was a~
maiden of Chalcedon, who suffered diverse tortures under the Proconsul Priscus.~
She endured unflinchingly the rods, the rack, the wheels, and the fire, and in~
the end was thrown to wild beasts. These all licked her feet, save one, which~
gave her holy body such a bite, that she forthwith resigned her guileless spirit~
to God. Lucy was a widow at Rome, who was accused by her own son Eutropius, for~
that she had for many years worshipped Christ. She was put into a vessel of hot~
pitch and lead, but came forth unhurt. As she was being haled through the city~
loaded with iron and lead, the sight of her faith and unwavering testification~
turned to Christ the nobleman Geminian. He was one of many whom she had brought~
to the faith, and she had him for a comrade in her glorious martyrdom, for he~
was diverse ways tormented, and then beheaded. Their bodies were given honourable~
burial by the Christian lady Maxima.
