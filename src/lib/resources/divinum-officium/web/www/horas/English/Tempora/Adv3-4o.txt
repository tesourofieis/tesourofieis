@Tempora/Adv3-4:Lectio2:4-5
7 Behold they that see shall cry without, the angels of peace shall weep bitterly.
8 The ways are made desolate, no one passeth by the road, the covenant is made void, he hath rejected the cities, he hath not regarded the men.
9 The land hath mourned, and languished: Libanus is confounded, and become foul, and Saron is become as a desert: and Basan and Carmel are shaken.
10 Now will I rise up, saith the Lord: now will I be exalted, now will I lift up myself.
11 You shall conceive heat, you shall bring forth stubble: your breath as fire shall devour you.
12 And the people shall be as ashes after a fire, as a bundle of thorns they shall be burnt with fire.
