[Hymnus Matutinum]
v. All that the ancient prophets preached,
and all that the books of the divine Law tell us
of holiness, is contained in the life of the great patriarch
which we are now extolling.
_
Moses was celebrated for his meekness;
Abraham for his being father of all believers;
Isaac for the beauty of his bride,
and his obedience to the trying commands of his father.
_
The sublime patriarch of our family was richly laden
with every virtue; and in his
Single person represented
Isaac, Moses, and Abraham.
_
May he have a loving care of those
whom he has delivered from this stormy world,
and lead them with prosperous gales to the port
where thee is no fear that can ruffle peace and repose.
_
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son that is begotten of him!
To thee, also, O Spirit of love,
coequal with them, one God,
be glory for endless ages.
Amen.

Sermon of St Peter Damian
!Sermon 9; for S. Benedict
Behold, we have forsaken all and followed thee. Solemn word, mighty undertaking, a holy work and one worthy of blessing, to leave all things and follow Christ. These are the persuasive words of voluntary poverty, which have brought forth monasteries, and filled the cloister with monks and the woods with anchorites. These are the words of which the Church sings: 'By the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.' We shall receive rest for our labour, riches for our poverty, a reward for our tribulation. It is a great thing to forsake all, but to follow Christ is a greater; for we read of many who have left all but who have not followed Christ. This is our task, this our labour; in this lies the essence of human salvation; nor can we follow Christ unless we forsake all, for He rejoices as a strong man to run a race, and he who bears a load cannot follow.

[Responsory9]
R. O Benedict, Most holy confessor of Christ, father and leader of monks,
* Intercede for us and the salvation of all.
V. Assist your devoted people with holy intercession so that with the help of your prayers they may reach the heavenly kingdom.
R. Intercede for us and the salvation of all.

[Lectio10]
'Behold' he says, 'we have forsaken all' not only the riches of this world but the desires of the soul too; for he who holds on to the self has not forsaken all. And it is useless to abandon other things if we do not abandon ourselves, since man's heaviest burden is man himself. What tyrant is more cruel to man, what power more savage, than his own will? Under its sway you can never rest or sit at your ease, and the more it wearies you in enforcing obedience to itself, the more it goads and stings and weighs you down, being unmindful of kindness and a stranger to mercy. This is the nature of self-will: the more obedient its subject, the more cruelly is he bound in its chains. 'What shall we have therefore?' Peter has forsaken all; not only is he following, he has followed for a long time; and now for the first time he asks what he will receive. What, Peter? Did you not promise obedience to the voice? You made no contract with the Lord. But listen to what the Lord God says, and await that hope in which, in this uncertain world, we must confide.' 'You shall sit', says the Lord who is Truth. Splendid sitting, welcome rest, full sufficiency.

[Responsory10]
R. In the year that was to be the last of his life, while some of his disciples were talking with him and some remained further away,
* The most holy man foretold the day of his death.
V. He bound them to strict secrecy, some others, he only informed of the special sign they would receive at the time of his death.
R. The most holy man foretold the day of his death.

[Lectio11]
But lest our long awaiting should mar the sweetness of His promise, He controls the restlessness of our minds with a sweeter word. For he knows our weakness; He knows that our cowardice cannot brook delays; in His loving kindness He meets this problem and counteracts it, saying: 'And everyone that has forsaken house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.' "The mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped'; now all they who transgress without cause are ashamed. For we have promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come; and it is clear that the promise of receiving a hundred-fold applies to this life, since the words which follow are 'and shall inherit everlasting life'.

[Responsory11]
R. On the sixth day, he had his disciples carry him into the oratory where he received the sacraments our Lord to gain strength for his approaching end
* Then, in the arms of his disciples he breathed his last
V. While for several days sickness had wasted his remaining energy, he stood with hands outstretched to heaven
R. Then, in the arms of his disciples he breathed his last

[Lectio12]
Those who have not yet received the hundredfold reward must scrutinize their hearts and diligently examine all the work of their hands; they will certainly find some corner or lodging-place unknown to the Saviour. And what is our hundredfold reward but the consolations, the visitations and the first fruits of the Spirit, sweeter than honey; the witness of our consciences; the joyous and lovely expectation of the just, the memory of God's abundant sweetness, the great multitude of His delights, of which there is no need to tell those who have known them, just as it is impossible to describe them to those who have not known them. There is no one to whom all this exposition of our text better applies than to our father and master St. Benedict. He forsook the world and all its flowers in boyhood to run with strong strides after the running Christ; and he did not rest until he had caught up with Him.

[Responsory12]
R. A straight road stretched eastwards from his cell until it reached up into heaven. And there in the brightness stood a man of majestic appearance, who asked them, Do you know who passed this way?
* They declared that they did not know.
V. This, he told them, is the road taken by blessed Benedict, the Lord's beloved, when he ascended to heaven.
R. They declared that they did not know.
