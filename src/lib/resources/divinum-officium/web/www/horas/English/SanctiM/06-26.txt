[Ant 2]
These are the holy ones * who for the love of Christ, recked nothing of the~
threats of men. In the kingdom of heaven the holy martyrs are filled with joy in~
the company of Angels. O how precious in the sight of the Lord was the death of~
these His saints And now they stand day and night in His presence and are~
not divided the one from the other.
