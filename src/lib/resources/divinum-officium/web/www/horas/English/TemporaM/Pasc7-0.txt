9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites and inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,
11 Jews also, and proselytes, Cretes, and Arabians: we have heard them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.

!Act. 2:12-15
12 And they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to another: What meaneth this?
13 But others mocking, said: These men are full of new wine.

Homily of Pope St Leo
!?
Dearly beloved, all Catholics know in their hearts that Pentecost is to be esteemed as one of the most important festivals. There is no question but that we owe great reverence to that day which the Holy Spirit has sanctified by his most excellent and wondrous Gift.

[Lectio6]
For this is the tenth day since the Lord ascended high above all heavens to sit down at the right hand of God the Father, and it is the fiftieth since his Resurrection, whereon the Lord initiated and made manifest mighty mysteries, binding together the old and the new covenants: thereby plainly revealing that grace was foreshadowed by the law, and that law has been perfected by grace.

[Lectio7]
For as of old, when the Hebrews had been freed from the yoke of the Egyptians, the Law was given on Mount Sinai on the fiftieth day after the sacrifice of the passover lamb; so after the Passion when the true lamb of God was slain, the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and upon the company of believers on the fiftieth day after his resurrection, in order that the faithful Christian might truly perceive that the mysteries of the Old Testament provide the foundations of the Gospel, and that the second Covenant was established by the same Spirit which had instituted the first.

[Lectio8]
From this day, therefore the preaching of the Gospel has sounded forth like a trumpet; from this day the gentle rain of the gifts of the Spirit, the rivers of blessings, have watered all the dry and thirsty desert: for the Spirit of the Lord moved upon the face of the waters, that he might renew the face of the earth.; the new flames shone forth to chase away the old darkness with the brilliancy of fiery tongues and the clarity of the Word of God; flaming eloquence is conceived, from which proceeds understanding and the doing away of sins, through the Spirit's power of consuming and enlightening as by fire.
