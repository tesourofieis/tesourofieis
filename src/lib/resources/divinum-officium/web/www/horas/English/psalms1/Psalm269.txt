(Canticle of Jeremias * Jer 14:17-21)
14:17 Let my eyes shed down tears night and day, * and let them not cease,
14:17 Because the virgin daughter of my people is afflicted with a great affliction, * with an exceeding grievous evil.
14:18 If I go forth into the fields, behold the slain with the sword: * and if I enter into the city, behold them that are consumed with famine.
14:18 The prophet also and the priest are gone into a land * which they knew not.
14:19 Hast thou utterly cast away Juda, * or hath thy soul abhorred Sion?
14:19 Why then hast thou struck us, * so that there is no healing for us?
14:19 We have looked for peace, and there is no good: * and for the time of healing, and behold trouble.
14:20 We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness, * the iniquities of our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
14:21 Give us not to be a reproach, for thy name's sake, * and do not disgrace in us the throne of thy glory:
14:21 Remember, * break not thy covenant with us.
