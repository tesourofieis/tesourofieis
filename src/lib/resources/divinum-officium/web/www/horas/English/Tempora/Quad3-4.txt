[Lectio3]
It was well that He began to heal on the Sabbath, that He might show Himself to be the Creator, weaving in one with another of His works, and continuing that which He had already begun, even as a workman, being to repair an house, beginneth not to take down that which is old from the foundations, but from the roof. Thus doth the Lord begin to lay to His hand again, in that place whence last He hath lifted it; then He beginneth which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. (Eph. iv. 22.) with things lesser, that He may go on to things greater. Even men are able to deliver other men from evil spirits, albeit with the word of God to command the dead to rise again is for God's power alone. Perchance, also, this woman, the mother-in-law of Simon and Andrew, was a type of our nature, stricken down with the great fever of sin, and burning with unlawful lusts after diverse objects. Nor would I say that the passion which rageth in the mind is a lesser fire than that fever which burneth the body. Covetousness, and lust, and uncleanness, and vain desires, and strivings, and anger, these be our fevers.

[Ant 2]
And devils also came out of many, * crying out and saying: Thou art Christ, the Son of God. And He, rebuking them, suffered them not to speak, for they knew that He was Christ.

[Oratio 2]
Praise be to thee, O Lord, for the blessed and solemn victory of thine holy servants Cosmas and Damian, whereby Thou, in thine unspeakable Providence, wast pleased to give unto them everlasting glory, and unto us a shield and succour.
$Per Dominum

[Ant 3]
All they that had * any sick brought them unto Jesus, and He healed them.

[Oratio 3]
Lord, we beseech thee that thine heavenly Peace-Offering may so effectually work for all thy people, which are now bowing themselves down before thee, that they may ever continue in meek obedience to thy commandments.
