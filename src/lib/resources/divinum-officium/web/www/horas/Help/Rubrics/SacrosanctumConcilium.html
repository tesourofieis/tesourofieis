    <p align="center">POPE PAUL VI <br>
    ON DECEMBER 4, 1963</p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p>
    <p>1. This sacred Council has several aims in view: it desires to impart an ever
    increasing vigor to the Christian life of the faithful; to adapt more suitably to the
    needs of our own times those institutions which are subject to change; to foster whatever
    can promote union among all who believe in Christ; to strengthen whatever can help to call
    the whole of mankind into the household of the Church. The Council therefore sees
    particularly cogent reasons for undertaking the reform and promotion of the liturgy. </p>
    <p>2. For the liturgy, &quot;through which the work of our redemption is
    accomplished,&quot; (1) most of all in the divine sacrifice of the eucharist, is the
    outstanding means whereby the faithful may express in their lives, and manifest to others,
    the mystery of Christ and the real nature of the true Church. It is of the essence of the
    Church that she be both human and divine, visible and yet invisibly equipped, eager to act
    and yet intent on contemplation, present in this world and yet not at home in it; and she
    is all these things in such wise that in her the human is directed and subordinated to the
    divine, the visible likewise to the invisible, action to contemplation, and this present
    world to that city yet to come, which we seek (2). While the liturgy daily builds up those
    who are within into a holy temple of the Lord, into a dwelling place for God in the Spirit
    (3), to the mature measure of the fullness of Christ (4), at the same time it marvelously
    strengthens their power to preach Christ, and thus shows forth the Church to those who are
    outside as a sign lifted up among the nations (5) under which the scattered children of
    God may be gathered together (6), until there is one sheepfold and one shepherd (7). </p>
    <p>3. Wherefore the sacred Council judges that the following principles concerning the
    promotion and reform of the liturgy should be called to mind, and that practical norms
    should be established. </p>
    <p>Among these principles and norms there are some which can and should be applied both to
    the Roman rite and also to all the other rites. The practical norms which follow, however,
    should be taken as applying only to the Roman rite, except for those which, in the very
    nature of things, affect other rites as well.</p>
    <p>4. Lastly, in faithful obedience to tradition, the sacred Council declares that holy
    Mother Church holds all lawfully acknowledged rites to be of equal right and dignity; that
    she wishes to preserve them in the future and to foster them in every way. The Council
    also desires that, where necessary, the rites be revised carefully in the light of sound
    tradition, and that they be given new vigor to meet the circumstances and needs of modern
    times. </p>
    <p align="center"><b>CHAPTER I </b></p>
    <p align="center"><b>GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR THE: RESTORATION AND PROMOTION OF THE SACRED
    LITURGY </b></p>
    <p><b>I. The Nature of the Sacred Liturgy and Its Importance in the Church's Life</b> </p>
    <p>5. God who &quot;wills that all men be saved and come to the knowledge of the
    truth&quot; (1 Tim. 2:4), &quot;who in many and various ways spoke in times past to the
    fathers by the prophets&quot; (Heb. 1:1), when the fullness of time had come sent His Son,
    the Word made flesh, anointed by the Holy Spirit, to preach the gospel to the poor, to
    heal the contrite of heart (8), to be a &quot;bodily and spiritual medicine&quot; (9), the
    Mediator between God and man (10). For His humanity, united with the person of the Word,
    was the instrument of our salvation. Therefore in Christ &quot;the perfect achievement of
    our reconciliation came forth, and the fullness of divine worship was given to us&quot;
    (11).</p>
    <p>The wonderful works of God among the people of the Old Testament were but a prelude to
    the work of Christ the Lord in redeeming mankind and giving perfect glory to God. He
    achieved His task principally by the paschal mystery of His blessed passions resurrection
    from the dead, and the glorious ascension, whereby &quot;dying, he destroyed our death,
    and rising, he restored our life&quot; (12). For it was from the side of Christ as He
    slept the sleep of death upon the cross that there came forth &quot;the wondrous sacrament
    of the whole Church&quot; (13).</p>
    <p>6. Just as Christ was sent by the Father, so also He sent the apostles, filled with the
    Holy Spirit. This He did that, by preaching the gospel to every creature (14), they might
    proclaim that the Son of God, by His death and resurrection, had freed us from the power
    of Satan (15) and from death, and brought us into the kingdom of His Father. His purpose
    also was that they might accomplish the work of salvation which they had proclaimed, by
    means of sacrifice and sacraments, around which the entire liturgical life revolves. Thus
    by baptism men are plunged into the paschal mystery of Christ: they die with Him, are
    buried with Him, and rise with Him (16); they receive the spirit of adoption as sons
    &quot;in which we cry: Abba, Father&quot; ( Rom. 8 :15), and thus become true adorers whom
    the Father seeks (17). In like manner, as often as they eat the supper of the Lord they
    proclaim the death of the Lord until He comes (18). For that reason, on the very day of
    Pentecost, when the Church appeared before the world, &quot;those who received the
    word&quot; of Peter &quot;were baptized.&quot; And &quot;they continued steadfastly in the
    teaching of the apostles and in the communion of the breaking of bread and in prayers . .
    . praising God and being in favor with all the people&quot; (Acts 2:41-47). From that time
    onwards the Church has never failed to come together to celebrate the paschal mystery:
    reading those things &quot;which were in all the scriptures concerning him&quot; (Luke
    24:27), celebrating the eucharist in which &quot;the victory and triumph of his death are
    again made present&quot; (19), and at the same time giving thanks &quot;to God for his
    unspeakable gift&quot; (2 Cor. 9:15) in Christ Jesus, &quot;in praise of his glory&quot;
    (Eph. 1:12), through the power of the Holy Spirit. </p>
    <p>7. To accomplish so great a work, Christ is always present in His Church, especially in
    her liturgical celebrations. He is present in the sacrifice of the Mass, not only in the
    person of His minister, &quot;the same now offering, through the ministry of priests, who
    formerly offered himself on the cross&quot; (20), but especially under the eucharistic
    species. By His power He is present in the sacraments, so that when a man baptizes it is
    really Christ Himself who baptizes (21). He is present in His word, since it is He Himself
    who speaks when the holy scriptures are read in the Church. He is present, lastly, when
    the Church prays and sings, for He promised: &quot;Where two or three are gathered
    together in my name, there am I in the midst of them&quot; (Matt. 18:20) .</p>
    <p>Christ indeed always associates the Church with Himself in this great work wherein God
    is perfectly glorified and men are sanctified. The Church is His beloved Bride who calls
    to her Lord, and through Him offers worship to the Eternal Father.</p>
    <p>Rightly, then, the liturgy is considered as an exercise of the priestly office of Jesus
    Christ. In the liturgy the sanctification of the man is signified by signs perceptible to
    the senses, and is effected in a way which corresponds with each of these signs; in the
    liturgy the whole public worship is performed by the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ, that
    is, by the Head and His members.</p>
    <p>From this it follows that every liturgical celebration, because it is an action of
    Christ the priest and of His Body which is the Church, is a sacred action surpassing all
    others; no other action of the Church can equal its efficacy by the same title and to the
    same degree.</p>
    <p>8. In the earthly liturgy we take part in a foretaste of that heavenly liturgy which is
    celebrated in the holy city of Jerusalem toward which we journey as pilgrims, where Christ
    is sitting at the right hand of God, a minister of the holies and of the true tabernacle
    (22); we sing a hymn to the Lord's glory with all the warriors of the heavenly army;
    venerating the memory of the saints, we hope for some part and fellowship with them; we
    eagerly await the Saviour, Our Lord Jesus Christ, until He, our life, shall appear and we
    too will appear with Him in glory (23).</p>
    <p>9. The sacred liturgy does not exhaust the entire activity of the Church. Before men
    can come to the liturgy they must be called to faith and to conversion: &quot;How then are
    they to call upon him in whom they have not yet believed? But how are they to believe him
    whom they have not heard? And how are they to hear if no one preaches? And how are men to
    preach unless they be sent?&quot; (Rom. 10:14-15).</p>
    <p>Therefore the Church announces the good tidings of salvation to those who do not
    believe, so that all men may know the true God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent, and may
    be converted from their ways, doing penance (24). To believers also the Church must ever
    preach faith and penance, she must prepare them for the sacraments, teach them to observe
    all that Christ has commanded (25), and invite them to all the works of charity, piety,
    and the apostolate. For all these works make it clear that Christ's faithful, though not
    of this world, are to be the light of the world and to glorify the Father before men.</p>
    <p>10. Nevertheless the liturgy is the summit toward which the activity of the Church is
    directed; at the same time it is the font from which all her power flows. For the aim and
    object of apostolic works is that all who are made sons of God by faith and baptism should
    come together to praise God in the midst of His Church, to take part in the sacrifice, and
    to eat the Lord's supper.</p>
    <p>The liturgy in its turn moves the faithful, filled with &quot;the paschal
    sacraments,&quot; to be &quot;one in holiness&quot; (26); it prays that &quot;they may
    hold fast in their lives to what they have grasped by their faith&quot; (27); the renewal
    in the eucharist of the covenant between the Lord and man draws the faithful into the
    compelling love of Christ and sets them on fire. From the liturgy, therefore, and
    especially from the eucharist, as from a font, grace is poured forth upon us; and the
    sanctification of men in Christ and the glorification of God, to which all other
    activities of the Church are directed as toward their end, is achieved in the most
    efficacious possible way. </p>
    <p>11. But in order that the liturgy may be able to produce its full effects, it is
    necessary that the faithful come to it with proper dispositions, that their minds should
    be attuned to their voices, and that they should cooperate with divine grace lest they
    receive it in vain (28) . Pastors of souls must therefore realize that, when the liturgy
    is celebrated, something more is required than the mere observation of the laws governing
    valid and licit celebration; it is their duty also to ensure that the faithful take part
    fully aware of what they are doing, actively engaged in the rite, and enriched by its
    effects. </p>
    <p>12. The spiritual life, however, is not limited solely to participation in the liturgy.
    The Christian is indeed called to pray with his brethren, but he must also enter into his
    chamber to pray to the Father, in secret (29); yet more, according to the teaching of the
    Apostle, he should pray without ceasing (30). We learn from the same Apostle that we must
    always bear about in our body the dying of Jesus, so that the life also of Jesus may be
    made manifest in our bodily frame (31). This is why we ask the Lord in the sacrifice of
    the Mass that, &quot;receiving the offering of the spiritual victim,&quot; he may fashion
    us for himself &quot;as an eternal gift&quot; (32).</p>
    <p>13. Popular devotions of the Christian people are to be highly commended, provided they
    accord with the laws and norms of the Church, above all when they are ordered by the
    Apostolic See.</p>
    <p>Devotions proper to individual Churches also have a special dignity if they are
    undertaken by mandate of the bishops according to customs or books lawfully approved.</p>
    <p>But these devotions should be so drawn up that they harmonize with the liturgical
    seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the
    people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by its very nature far surpasses any of them. </p>
    <p><b>II. The Promotion of Liturgical Instruction and Active Participation </b></p>
    <p>14. Mother Church earnestly desires that all the faithful should be led to that fully
    conscious, and active participation in liturgical celebrations which is demanded by the
    very nature of the liturgy. Such participation by the Christian people as &quot;a chosen
    race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a redeemed people (1 Pet. 2:9; cf. 2:4-5), is
    their right and duty by reason of their baptism.</p>
    <p>In the restoration and promotion of the sacred liturgy, this full and active
    participation by all the people is the aim to be considered before all else; for it is the
    primary and indispensable source from which the faithful are to derive the true Christian
    spirit; and therefore pastors of souls must zealously strive to achieve it, by means of
    the necessary instruction, in all their pastoral work.</p>
    <p>Yet it would be futile to entertain any hopes of realizing this unless the pastors
    themselves, in the first place, become thoroughly imbued with the spirit and power of the
    liturgy, and undertake to give instruction about it. A prime need, therefore, is that
    attention be directed, first of all, to the liturgical instruction of the clergy.
    Wherefore the sacred Council has decided to enact as follows:</p>
    <p>15. Professors who are appointed to teach liturgy in seminaries, religious houses of
    study, and theological faculties must be properly trained for their work in institutes
    which specialize in this subject.</p>
    <p>16. The study of sacred liturgy is to be ranked among the compulsory and major courses
    in seminaries and religions houses of studies; in theological faculties it is to rank
    among the principal courses. It is to be taught under its theological, historical,
    spiritual, pastoral, and juridical aspects. Moreover, other professors, while striving to
    expound the mystery of Christ and the history of salvation from the angle proper to each
    of their own subjects, must nevertheless do so in a way which will clearly bring out the
    connection between their subjects and the liturgy, as also the unity which underlies all
    priestly training. This consideration is especially important for professors of dogmatic,
    spiritual, and pastoral theology and for those of holy scripture.</p>
    <p>17. In seminaries and houses of religious, clerics shall be given a liturgical
    formation in their spiritual life. For this they will need proper direction, so that they
    may be able to understand the sacred rites and take part in them wholeheartedly; and they
    will also need personally to celebrate the sacred mysteries, as well as popular devotions
    which are imbued with the spirit of the liturgy. In addition they must learn how to
    observe the liturgical laws, so that life in seminaries and houses of religious may be
    thoroughly influenced by the spirit of the liturgy.</p>
    <p>18. Priests, both secular and religious, who are already working in the Lord's vineyard
    are to be helped by every suitable means to understand ever more fully what it is that
    they are doing when they perform sacred rites; they are to be aided to live the liturgical
    life and to share it with the faithful entrusted to their care.</p>
    <p>19. With zeal and patience, pastors of souls must promote the liturgical instruction of
    the faithful, and also their active participation in the liturgy both internally and
    externally, taking into account their age and condition, their way of life, and standard
    of religious culture. By so doing, pastors will be fulfilling one of the chief duties of a
    faithful dispenser of the mysteries of God; and in this matter they must lead their flock
    not only in word but also by example.</p>
    <p>20. Transmissions of the sacred rites by radio and television shall be done with
    discretion and dignity, under the leadership and direction of a suitable person appointed
    for this office by the bishops. This is especially important when the service to be
    broadcast is the Mass. </p>
    <p><b>III. The Reform of the Sacred Liturgy</b> </p>
    <p>21. In order that the Christian people may more certainly derive an abundance of graces
    from the sacred liturgy, holy Mother Church desires to undertake with great care a general
    restoration of the liturgy itself. For the liturgy is made up of immutable elements
    divinely instituted, and of elements subject to change. These not only may but ought to be
    changed with the passage of time if they have suffered from the intrusion of anything out
    of harmony with the inner nature of the liturgy or have become unsuited to it.</p>
    <p>In this restoration, both texts and rites should be drawn up so that they express more
    clearly the holy things which they signify; the Christian people, so far as possible,
    should be enabled to understand them with ease and to take part in them fully, actively,
    and as befits a community.</p>
    <p>Wherefore the sacred Council establishes the following general norms: </p>
    <p><i><b>A) General norms</b></i> </p>
    <p>22. 1. Regulation of the sacred liturgy depends solely on the authority of the Church,
    that is, on the Apostolic See and, as laws may determine, on the bishop. </p>
    <p>2. In virtue of power conceded by the law, the regulation of the liturgy within certain
    defined limits belongs also to various kinds of competent territorial bodies of bishops
    legitimately established.</p>
    <p>3. Therefore no other person, even if he be a priest, may add, remove, or change
    anything in the liturgy on his own authority.</p>
    <p>23. That sound tradition may be retained, and yet the way remain open to legitimate
    progress Careful investigation is always to be made into each part of the liturgy which is
    to be revised. This investigation should be theological, historical, and pastoral. Also
    the general laws governing the structure and meaning of the liturgy must be studied in
    conjunction with the experience derived from recent liturgical reforms and from the
    indults conceded to various places. Finally, there must be no innovations unless the good
    of the Church genuinely and certainly requires them; and care must be taken that any new
    forms adopted should in some way grow organically from forms already existing.</p>
    <p>As far as possible, notable differences between the rites used in adjacent regions must
    be carefully avoided.</p>
    <p>24. Sacred scripture is of the greatest importance in the celebration of the liturgy.
    For it is from scripture that lessons are read and explained in the homily, and psalms are
    sung; the prayers, collects, and liturgical songs are scriptural in their inspiration and
    their force, and it is from the scriptures that actions and signs derive their meaning.
    Thus to achieve the restoration, progress, and adaptation of the sacred liturgy, it is
    essential to promote that warm and living love for scripture to which the venerable
    tradition of both eastern and western rites gives testimony.</p>
    <p>25. The liturgical books are to be revised as soon as possible; experts are to be
    employed on the task, and bishops are to be consulted, from various parts of the world. </p>
    <p><i><b>B) Norms drawn from the hierarchic and communal nature of the Liturgy </b></i></p>
    <p>26. Liturgical services are not private functions, but are celebrations of the Church,
    which is the &quot;sacrament of unity,&quot; namely, the holy people united and ordered
    under their bishops (33)</p>
    <p>Therefore liturgical services pertain to the whole body of the Church; they manifest it
    and have effects upon it; but they concern the individual members of the Church in
    different ways, according to their differing rank, office, and actual participation. </p>
    <p>27. It is to be stressed that whenever rites, according to their specific nature, make
    provision for communal celebration involving the presence and active participation of the
    faithful, this way of celebrating them is to be preferred, so far as possible, to a
    celebration that is individual and quasi-private.</p>
    <p>This applies with especial force to the celebration of Mass and the administration of
    the sacraments, even though every Mass has of itself a public and social nature.</p>
    <p>28. In liturgical celebrations each person, minister or layman, who has an office to
    perform, should do all of, but only, those parts which pertain to his office by the nature
    of the rite and the principles of liturgy.</p>
    <p>29. Servers, lectors commentators, and members of the choir also exercise a genuine
    liturgical function. They ought, therefore, to discharge their office with the sincere
    piety and decorum demanded by so exalted a ministry and rightly expected of them by God's
    people.</p>
    <p>Consequently they must all be deeply imbued with the spirit of the liturgy, each in his
    own measure, and they must be trained to perform their functions in a correct and orderly
    manner.</p>
    <p>30. To promote active participation, the people should be encouraged to take part by
    means of acclamations, responses, psalmody, antiphons, and songs, as well as by actions,
    gestures, and bodily attitudes. And at the proper times all should observe a reverent
    silence.</p>
    <p>31. The revision of the liturgical books must carefully attend to the provision of
    rubrics also for the people's parts.</p>
    <p>32. The liturgy makes distinctions between persons according to their liturgical
    function and sacred Orders, and there are liturgical laws providing for due honors to be
    given to civil authorities. Apart from these instances, no special honors are to be paid
    in the liturgy to any private persons or classes of persons, whether in the ceremonies or
    by external display. </p>
    <p><i><b>C) Norms based upon the didactic and pastoral nature of the Liturgy </b></i></p>
    <p>33. Although the sacred liturgy is above all things the worship of the divine Majesty,
    it likewise contains much instruction for the faithful (34). For in the liturgy God speaks
    to His people and Christ is still proclaiming His gospel. And the people reply to God both
    by song and prayer.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the prayers addressed to God by the priest who presides over the assembly in
    the person of Christ are said in the name of the entire holy people and of all present.
    And the visible signs used by the liturgy to signify invisible divine things have been
    chosen by Christ or the Church. Thus not only when things are read &quot;which were
    written for our instruction&quot; (Rom. 15:4), but also when the Church prays or sings or
    acts, the faith of those taking part is nourished and their minds are raised to God, so
    that they may offer Him their rational service and more abundantly receive His grace. </p>
    <p>Wherefore, in the revision of the liturgy, the following general norms should be
    observed:</p>
    <p>34. The rites should be distinguished by a noble simplicity; they should be short,
    clear, and unencumbered by useless repetitions; they should be within the people's powers
    of comprehension, and normally should not require much explanation.</p>
    <p>35. That the intimate connection between words and rites may be apparent in the
    liturgy: </p>
    <p>1) In sacred celebrations there is to be more reading from holy scripture, and it is to
    be more varied and suitable. </p>
    <p>2) Because the sermon is part of the liturgical service, the best place for it is to be
    indicated even in the rubrics, as far as the nature of the rite will allow; the ministry
    of preaching is to be fulfilled with exactitude and fidelity. The sermon, moreover, should
    draw its content mainly from scriptural and liturgical sources, and its character should
    be that of a proclamation of God's wonderful works in the history of salvation, the
    mystery of Christ, ever made present and active within us, especially in the celebration
    of the liturgy.</p>
    <p>3) Instruction which is more explicitly liturgical should also be given in a variety of
    ways; if necessary, short directives to be spoken by the priest or proper minister should
    be provided within the rites themselves. But they should occur only at the more suitable
    moments, and be in prescribed or similar words.</p>
    <p>4) Bible services should be encouraged, especially on the vigils of the more solemn
    feasts, on some weekdays in Advent and Lent, and on Sundays and feast days. They are
    particularly to be commended in places where no priest is available; when this is so, a
    deacon or some other person authorized by the bishop should preside over the celebration.</p>
    <p>36. 1. Particular law remaining in force, the use of the Latin language is to be
    preserved in the Latin rites.</p>
    <p>2. But since the use of the mother tongue, whether in the Mass, the administration of
    the sacraments, or other parts of the liturgy, frequently may be of great advantage to the
    people, the limits of its employment may be extended. This will apply in the first place
    to the readings and directives, and to some of the prayers and chants, according to the
    regulations on this matter to be laid down separately in subsequent chapters.</p>
    <p>3. These norms being observed, it is for the competent territorial ecclesiastical
    authority mentioned in Art. 22, 2, to decide whether, and to what extent, the vernacular
    language is to be used; their decrees are to be approved, that is, confirmed, by the
    Apostolic See. And, whenever it seems to be called for, this authority is to consult with
    bishops of neighboring regions which have the same language.</p>
    <p>4. Translations from the Latin text into the mother tongue intended for use in the
    liturgy must be approved by the competent territorial ecclesiastical authority mentioned
    above. </p>
    <p><i><b>D) Norms for adapting the Liturgy to the culture and traditions of peoples</b> </i></p>
    <p>37. Even in the liturgy, the Church has no wish to impose a rigid uniformity in matters
    which do not implicate the faith or the good of the whole community; rather does she
    respect and foster the genius and talents of the various races and peoples. Anything in
    these peoples' way of life which is not indissolubly bound up with superstition and error
    she studies with sympathy and, if possible, preserves intact. Sometimes in fact she admits
    such things into the liturgy itself, so long as they harmonize with its true and authentic
    spirit.</p>
    <p>38. Provisions shall also be made, when revising the liturgical books, for legitimate
    variations and adaptations to different groups, regions, and peoples, especially in
    mission lands, provided that the substantial unity of the Roman rite is preserved; and
    this should be borne in mind when drawing up the rites and devising rubrics.</p>
    <p>39. Within the limits set by the typical editions of the liturgical books, it shall be
    for the competent territorial ecclesiastical authority mentioned in Art. 22, 2, to specify
    adaptations, especially in the case of the administration of the sacraments, the
    sacramentals, processions, liturgical language, sacred music, and the arts, but according
    to the fundamental norms laid down in this Constitution.</p>
    <p>40. In some places and circumstances, however, an even more radical adaptation of the
    liturgy is needed, and this entails greater difficulties. Wherefore: </p>
    <p>1) The competent territorial ecclesiastical authority mentioned in Art. 22, 2, must, in
    this matter, carefully and prudently consider which elements from the traditions and
    culture of individual peoples might appropriately be admitted into divine worship.
    Adaptations which are judged to be useful or necessary should when be submitted to the
    Apostolic See, by whose consent they may be introduced.</p>
    <p>2) To ensure that adaptations may be made with all the circumspection which they
    demand, the Apostolic See will grant power to this same territorial ecclesiastical
    authority to permit and to direct, as the case requires, the necessary preliminary
    experiments over a determined period of time among certain groups suited for the purpose.</p>
    <p>3) Because liturgical laws often involve special difficulties with respect to
    adaptation, particularly in mission lands, men who are experts in these matters must be
    employed to formulate them. </p>
    <p><i><b>E) Promotion of Liturgical Life in Diocese and Parish</b></i> </p>
    <p>41. The bishop is to be considered as the high priest of his flock, from whom the life
    in Christ of his faithful is in some way derived and dependent.</p>
    <p>Therefore all should hold in great esteem the liturgical life of the diocese centered
    around the bishop, especially in his cathedral church; they must be convinced that the
    pre-eminent manifestation of the Church consists in the full active participation of all
    God's holy people in these liturgical celebrations, especially in the same eucharist, in a
    single prayer, at one altar, at which there presides the bishop surrounded by his college
    of priests and by his ministers (35).</p>
    <p>42. But because it is impossible for the bishop always and everywhere to preside over
    the whole flock in his Church, he cannot do other than establish lesser groupings of the
    faithful. Among these the parishes, set up locally under a pastor who takes the place of
    the bishop, are the most important: for in some manner they represent the visible Church
    constituted throughout the world.</p>
    <p>And therefore the liturgical life of the parish and its relationship to the bishop must
    be fostered theoretically and practically among the faithful and clergy; efforts also must
    be made to encourage a sense of community within the parish, above all in the common
    celebration of the Sunday Mass. </p>
    <p><i><b>F) The Promotion of Pastoral-Liturgical Action </b></i></p>
    <p>43. Zeal for the promotion and restoration of the liturgy is rightly held to be a sign
    of the providential dispositions of God in our time, as a movement of the Holy Spirit in
    His Church. It is today a distinguishing mark of the Church's life, indeed of the whole
    tenor of contemporary religious thought and action.</p>
    <p>So that this pastoral-liturgical action may become even more vigorous in the Church,
    the sacred Council decrees:</p>
    <p>44. It is desirable that the competent territorial ecclesiastical authority mentioned
    in Art. 22, 2, set up a liturgical commission, to be assisted by experts in liturgical
    science, sacred music, art and pastoral practice. So far as possible the commission should
    be aided by some kind of Institute for Pastoral Liturgy, consisting of persons who are
    eminent in these matters, and including laymen as circumstances suggest. Under the
    direction of the above-mentioned territorial ecclesiastical authority the commission is to
    regulate pastoral-liturgical action throughout the territory, and to promote studies and
    necessary experiments whenever there is question of adaptations to be proposed to the
    Apostolic See.</p>
    <p>45. For the same reason every diocese is to have a commission on the sacred liturgy
    under the direction of the bishop, for promoting the liturgical apostolate.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it may be expedient that several dioceses should form between them one single
    commission which will be able to promote the liturgy by common consultation.</p>
    <p>46. Besides the commission on the sacred liturgy, every diocese, as far as possible,
    should have commissions for sacred music and sacred art.</p>
    <p>These three commissions must work in closest collaboration; indeed it will often be
    best to fuse the three of them into one single commission. </p>
    <p align="center"><b>CHAPTER II </b></p>
    <p align="center"><b>THE MOST SACRED MYSTERY OF THE EUCHARIST</b> </p>
    <p>47. At the Last Supper, on the night when He was betrayed, our Saviour instituted the
    eucharistic sacrifice of His Body and Blood. He did this in order to perpetuate the
    sacrifice of the Cross throughout the centuries until He should come again, and so to
    entrust to His beloved spouse, the Church, a memorial of His death and resurrection: a
    sacrament of love, a sign of unity, a bond of charity (36), a paschal banquet in which
    Christ is eaten, the mind is filled with grace, and a pledge of future glory is given to
    us (37).</p>
    <p>48. The Church, therefore, earnestly desires that Christ's faithful, when present at
    this mystery of faith, should not be there as strangers or silent spectators; on the
    contrary, through a good understanding of the rites and prayers they should take part in
    the sacred action conscious of what they are doing, with devotion and full collaboration.
    They should be instructed by God's word and be nourished at the table of the Lord's body;
    they should give thanks to God; by offering the Immaculate Victim, not only through the
    hands of the priest, but also with him, they should learn also to offer themselves;
    through Christ the Mediator (38), they should be drawn day by day into ever more perfect
    union with God and with each other, so that finally God may be all in all.</p>
    <p>49. For this reason the sacred Council, having in mind those Masses which are
    celebrated with the assistance of the faithful, especially on Sundays and feasts of
    obligation, has made the following decrees in order that the sacrifice of the Mass, even
    in the ritual forms of its celebration, may become pastorally efficacious to the fullest
    degree.</p>
    <p>50. The rite of the Mass is to be revised in such a way that the intrinsic nature and
    purpose of its several parts, as also the connection between them, may be more clearly
    manifested, and that devout and active participation by the faithful may be more easily
    achieved.</p>
    <p>For this purpose the rites are to be simplified, due care being taken to preserve their
    substance; elements which, with the passage of time, came to be duplicated, or were added
    with but little advantage, are now to be discarded; other elements which have suffered
    injury through accidents of history are now to be restored to the vigor which they had in
    the days of the holy Fathers, as may seem useful or necessary.</p>
    <p>51. The treasures of the bible are to be opened up more lavishly, so that richer fare
    may be provided for the faithful at the table of God's word. In this way a more
    representative portion of the holy scriptures will be read to the people in the course of
    a prescribed number of years.</p>
    <p>52. By means of the homily the mysteries of the faith and the guiding principles of the
    Christian life are expounded from the sacred text, during the course of the liturgical
    year; the homily, therefore, is to be highly esteemed as part of the liturgy itself; in
    fact, at those Masses which are celebrated with the assistance of the people on Sundays
    and feasts of obligation, it should not be omitted except for a serious reason.</p>
    <p>53. Especially on Sundays and feasts of obligation there is to be restored, after the
    Gospel and the homily, &quot;the common prayer&quot; or &quot;the prayer of the
    faithful.&quot; By this prayer, in which the people are to take part, intercession will be
    made for holy Church, for the civil authorities, for those oppressed by various needs, for
    all mankind, and for the salvation of the entire world (39).</p>
    <p>54. In Masses which are celebrated with the people, a suitable place may be allotted to
    their mother tongue. This is to apply in the first place to the readings and &quot;the
    common prayer,&quot; but also, as local conditions may warrant, to those parts which
    pertain to the people, according to the norm laid down in Art. 36 of this Constitution.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless steps should be taken so that the faithful may also be able to say or to
    sing together in Latin those parts of the Ordinary of the Mass which pertain to them. </p>
    <p>And wherever a more extended use of the mother tongue within the Mass appears
    desirable, the regulation laid down in Art. 40 of this Constitution is to be observed.</p>
    <p>55. That more perfect form of participation in the Mass whereby the faithful, after the
    priest's communion, receive the Lord's body from the same sacrifice, is strongly
    commended.</p>
    <p>The dogmatic principles which were laid down by the Council of Trent remaining intact
    (40), communion under both kinds may be granted when the bishops think fit, not only to
    clerics and religious, but also to the laity, in cases to be determined by the Apostolic
    See, as, for instance, to the newly ordained in the Mass of their sacred ordination, to
    the newly professed in the Mass of their religious profession, and to the newly baptized
    in the Mass which follows their baptism.</p>
    <p>56. The two parts which, in a certain sense, go to make up the Mass, namely, the
    liturgy of the word and the eucharistic liturgy, are so closely connected with each other
    that they form but one single act of worship. Accordingly this sacred Synod strongly urges
    pastors of souls that, when instructing the faithful, they insistently teach them to take
    their part in the entire Mass, especially on Sundays and feasts of obligation.</p>
    <p>57. 1. Concelebration, whereby the unity of the priesthood is appropriately manifested,
    has remained in use to this day in the Church both in the east and in the west. For this
    reason it has seemed good to the Council to extend permission for concelebration to the
    following cases:</p>
    <p>1. </p>
    <p>a) on the Thursday of the Lord's Supper, not only at the Mass of the Chrism, but also
    at the evening Mass.</p>
    <p>b) at Masses during councils, bishops' conferences, and synods;</p>
    <p>c) at the Mass for the blessing of an abbot.</p>
    <p>2. Also, with permission of the ordinary, to whom it belongs to decide whether
    concelebration is opportune:</p>
    <p>a) at conventual Mass, and at the principle Mass in churches when the needs of the
    faithful do not require that all priests available should celebrate individually;</p>
    <p>b) at Masses celebrated at any kind of priests' meetings, whether the priests be
    secular clergy or religious.</p>
    <p>2.</p>
    <p>1. The regulation, however, of the discipline of con-celebration in the diocese
    pertains to the bishop.</p>
    <p>2. Nevertheless, each priest shall always retain his right to celebrate Mass
    individually, though not at the same time in the same church as a concelebrated Mass, nor
    on Thursday of the Lord's Supper.</p>
    <p>58. A new rite for concelebration is to be drawn up and inserted into the Pontifical
    and into the Roman Missal. </p>
    <p align="center"><b>CHAPTER III </b></p>
    <p align="center"><b>THE OTHER SACRAMENTS AND THE SACRAMENTALS </b></p>
    <p>59. The purpose of the sacraments is to sanctify men, to build up the body of Christ,
    and, finally, to give worship to God; because they are signs they also instruct. They not
    only presuppose faith, but by words and objects they also nourish, strengthen, and express
    it; that is why they are called &quot;sacraments of faith.&quot; They do indeed impart
    grace, but, in addition, the very act of celebrating them most effectively disposes the
    faithful to receive this grace in a fruitful manner, to worship God duly, and to practice
    charity.</p>
    <p>It is therefore of the highest importance that the faithful should easily understand
    the sacramental signs, and should frequent with great eagerness those sacraments which
    were instituted to nourish the Christian life.</p>
    <p>60. Holy Mother Church has, moreover, instituted sacramentals. These are sacred signs
    which bear a resemblance to the sacraments: they signify effects, particularly of a
    spiritual kind, which are obtained through the Church's intercession. By them men are
    disposed to receive the chief effect of the sacraments, and various occasions in life are
    rendered holy.</p>
    <p>61. Thus, for well-disposed members of the faithful, the liturgy of the sacraments and
    sacramentals sanctifies almost every event in their lives; they are given access to the
    stream of divine grace which flows from the paschal mystery of the passion, death, the
    resurrection of Christ, the font from which all sacraments and sacramentals draw their
    power. There is hardly any proper use of material things which cannot thus be directed
    toward the sanctification of men and the praise of God.</p>
    <p>62. With the passage of time, however, there have crept into the rites of the
    sacraments and sacramentals certain features which have rendered their nature and purpose
    far from clear to the people of today; hence some changes have become necessary to adapt
    them to the needs of our own times. For this reason the sacred Council decrees as follows
    concerning their revision.</p>
    <p>63. Because of the use of the mother tongue in the administration of the sacraments and
    sacramentals can often be of considerable help to the people, this use is to be extended
    according to the following norms:</p>
    <p>a) The vernacular language may be used in administering the sacraments and
    sacramentals, according to the norm of Art. 36.</p>
    <p>b) In harmony with the new edition of the Roman Ritual, particular rituals shall be
    prepared without delay by the competent territorial ecclesiastical authority mentioned in
    Art. 22, 2, of this Constitution. These rituals, which are to be adapted, also as regards
    the language employed, to the needs of the different regions, are to be reviewed by the
    Apostolic See and then introduced into the regions for which they have been prepared. But
    in drawing up these rituals or particular collections of rites, the instructions prefixed
    to the individual rites the Roman Ritual, whether they be pastoral and rubrical or whether
    they have special social import, shall not be omitted.</p>
    <p>64. The catechumenate for adults, comprising several distinct steps, is to be restored
    and to be taken into use at the discretion of the local ordinary. By this, means the time
    of the catechumenate, which is intended as a period of suitable instruction, may be
    sanctified by sacred rites to be celebrated at successive intervals of time.</p>
    <p>65. In mission lands it is found that some of the peoples already make use of
    initiation rites. Elements from these, when capable of being adapted to Christian ritual,
    may be admitted along with those already found in Christian tradition, according to the
    norm laid down in Art. 37-40, of this Constitution.</p>
    <p>66. Both the rites for the baptism of adults are to be revised: not only the simpler
    rite, but also the more solemn one, which must take into account the restored
    catechumenate. A special Mass &quot;for the conferring of baptism&quot; is to be inserted
    into the Roman Missal.</p>
    <p>67. The rite for the baptism of infants is to be revised, and it should be adapted to
    the circumstance that those to be baptized are, in fact, infants. The roles of parents and
    godparents, and also their duties, should be brought out more clearly in the rite itself.</p>
    <p>68. The baptismal rite should contain variants, to be used at the discretion of the
    local ordinary, for occasions when a very large number are to be baptized together.
    Moreover, a shorter rite is to be drawn up, especially for mission lands, to be used by
    catechists, but also by the faithful in general when there is danger of death, and neither
    priest nor deacon is available.</p>
    <p>69. In place of the rite called the &quot;Order of supplying what was omitted in the
    baptism of an infant,&quot; a new rite is to be drawn up. This should manifest more
    fittingly and clearly that the infant, baptized by the short rite, has already been
    received into the Church.</p>
    <p>And a new rite is to be drawn up for converts who have already been validly baptized;
    it should indicate that they are now admitted to communion with the Church. </p>
    <p>70. Except during Eastertide, baptismal water may be blessed within the rite of baptism
    itself by an approved shorter formula.</p>
    <p>71. The rite of confirmation is to be revised and the intimate connection which this
    sacrament has with the whole of Christian initiation is to be more clearly set forth; for
    this reason it is fitting for candidates to renew their baptismal promises just before
    they are confirmed.</p>
    <p>Confirmation may be given within the Mass when convenient; when it is given outside the
    Mass, the rite that is used should be introduced by a formula to be drawn up for this
    purpose.</p>
    <p>72. The rite and formulas for the sacrament of penance are to be revised so that they
    more clearly express both the nature and effect of the sacrament.</p>
    <p>73. &quot;Extreme unction,&quot; which may also and more fittingly be called
    &quot;anointing of the sick,&quot; is not a sacrament for those only who are at the point
    of death. Hence, as soon as any one of the faithful begins to be in danger of death from
    sickness or old age, the fitting time for him to receive this sacrament has certainly
    already arrived.</p>
    <p>74. In addition to the separate rites for anointing of the sick and for viaticum, a
    continuous rite shall be prepared according to which the sick man is anointed after he has
    made his confession and before he receives viaticum.</p>
    <p>75. The number of the anointings is to be adapted to the occasion, and the prayers
    which belong to the rite of anointing are to be revised so as to correspond with the
    varying conditions of the sick who receive the sacrament.</p>
    <p>76. Both the ceremonies and texts of the ordination rites are to be revised. The
    address given by the bishop at the beginning of each ordination or consecration may be in
    the mother tongue.</p>
    <p>When a bishop is consecrated, the laying of hands may be done by all the bishops
    present.</p>
    <p>77. The marriage rite now found in the Roman Ritual is to be revised and enriched in
    such a way that the grace of the sacrament is more clearly signified and the duties of the
    spouses are taught.</p>
    <p>&quot;If any regions are wont to use other praiseworthy customs and ceremonies when
    celebrating the sacrament of matrimony, the sacred Synod earnestly desires that these by
    all means be retained&quot; (41).</p>
    <p>Moreover the competent territorial ecclesiastical authority mentioned in Art. 22, 52,
    of this Constitution is free to draw up its own rite suited to the usages of place and
    people, according to the provision of Art. 63. But the rite must always conform to the law
    that the priest assisting at the marriage must ask for and obtain the consent of the
    contracting parties.</p>
    <p>78. Matrimony is normally to be celebrated within the Mass, after the reading of the
    gospel and the homily, and before &quot;the prayer of the faithful.&quot; The prayer for
    the bride, duly amended to remind both spouses of their equal obligation to remain
    faithful to each other, may be said in the mother tongue.</p>
    <p>But if the sacrament of matrimony is celebrated apart from Mass, the epistle and gospel
    from the nuptial Mass are to be read at the beginning of the rite, and the blessing should
    always be given to the spouses.</p>
    <p>79. The sacramentals are to undergo a revision which takes into account the primary
    principle of enabling the faithful to participate intelligently, actively, and easily; the
    circumstances of our own days must also be considered. When rituals are revised, as laid
    down in Art. 63, new sacramentals may also be added as the need for these becomes
    apparent.</p>
    <p>Reserved blessings shall be very few; reservations shall be in favor of bishops or
    ordinaries.</p>
    <p>Let provision be made that some sacramentals, at least in special circumstances and at
    the discretion of the ordinary, may be administered by qualified lay persons.</p>
    <p>80. The rite for the consecration of virgins at present found in the Roman Pontifical
    is to be revised.</p>
    <p>Moreover, a rite of religious profession and renewal of vows shall be drawn up in order
    to achieve greater unity, sobriety, and dignity. Apart from exceptions in particular law,
    this rite should be adopted by those who make their profession or renewal of vows within
    the Mass.</p>
    <p>Religious profession should preferably be made within the Mass.</p>
    <p>81. The rite for the burial of the dead should express more clearly the paschal
    character of Christian death, and should correspond more closely to the circumstances and
    traditions found in various regions. This holds good also for the liturgical color to be
    used.</p>
    <p>82. The rite for the burial of infants is to be revised, and a special Mass for the
    occasion should be provided. </p>
    <p align="center"><b>CHAPTER IV</b> </p>
    <p align="center"><b>THE DIVINE OFFICE </b></p>
    <p>83. Christ Jesus, high priest of the new and eternal covenant, taking human nature,
    introduced into this earthly exile that hymn which is sung throughout all ages in the
    halls of heaven. He joins the entire community of mankind to Himself, associating it with
    His own singing of this canticle of divine praise.</p>
    <p>For he continues His priestly work through the agency of His Church, which is
    ceaselessly engaged in praising the Lord and interceding for the salvation of the whole
    world. She does this, not only by celebrating the eucharist, but also in other ways,
    especially by praying the divine office.</p>
    <p>84. By tradition going back to early Christian times, the divine office is devised so
    that the whole course of the day and night is made holy by the praises of God. Therefore,
    when this wonderful song of praise is rightly performed by priests and others who are
    deputed for this purpose by the Church's ordinance, or by the faithful praying together
    with the priest in the approved form, then it is truly the voice of the bride addressed to
    her bridegroom; it is the very prayer which Christ Himself, together with His body,
    addresses to the Father.</p>
    <p>85. Hence all who render this service are not only fulfilling a duty of the Church, but
    also are sharing in the greatest honor of Christ's spouse, for by offering these praises
    to God they are standing before God's throne in the name of the Church their Mother.</p>
    <p>86. Priests who are engaged in the sacred pastoral ministry will offer the praises of
    the hours with greater fervor the more vividly they realize that they must heed St. Paul's
    exhortation: &quot;Pray without ceasing&quot; (1 Thess. 5:11). For the work in which they
    labor will effect nothing and bring forth no fruit except by the power of the Lord who
    said: &quot;Without me you can do nothing&quot; (John 15: 5). That is why the apostles,
    instituting deacons, said: &quot;We will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of
    the word&quot; (Acts 6:4).</p>
    <p>87. In order that the divine office may be better and more perfectly prayed in existing
    circumstances, whether by priests or by other members of the Church, the sacred Council,
    carrying further the restoration already so happily begun by the Apostolic See, has seen
    fit to decree as follows concerning the office of the Roman rite.</p>
    <p>88. Because the purpose of the office is to sanctify the day, the traditional sequence
    of the hours is to be restored so that once again they may be genuinely related to the
    time of the day when they are prayed, as far as this may be possible. Moreover, it will be
    necessary to take into account the modern conditions in which daily life has to be lived,
    especially by those who are called to labor in apostolic works.</p>
    <p>89. Therefore, when the office is revised, these norms are to be observed:</p>
    <p>a) By the venerable tradition of the universal Church, Lauds as morning prayer and
    Vespers as evening prayer are the two hinges on which the daily office turns; hence they
    are to be considered as the chief hours and are to be celebrated as such.</p>
    <p>b) Compline is to be drawn up so that it will be a suitable prayer for the end of the
    day.</p>
    <p>c) The hour known as Matins, although it should retain the character of nocturnal
    praise when celebrated in choir, shall be adapted so that it may be recited at any hour of
    the day; it shall be made up of fewer psalms and longer readings. </p>
    <p>d) The hour of Prime is to be suppressed.</p>
    <p>e) In choir the hours of Terce, Sext, and None are to be observed. But outside choir it
    will be lawful to select any one of these three, according to the respective time of the
    day.</p>
    <p>90. The divine office, because it is the public prayer of the Church, is a source of
    piety, and nourishment for personal prayer. And therefore priests and all others who take
    part in the divine office are earnestly exhorted in the Lord to attune their minds to
    their voices when praying it. The better to achieve this, let them take steps to improve
    their understanding of the liturgy and of the bible, especially of the psalms.</p>
    <p>In revising the Roman office, its ancient and venerable treasures are to be so adapted
    that all those to whom they are handed on may more extensively and easily draw profit from
    them.</p>
    <p>91. So that it may really be possible in practice to observe the course of the hours
    proposed in Art. 89, the psalms are no longer to be distributed throughout one week, but
    through some longer period of time.</p>
    <p>The work of revising the psalter, already happily begun, is to be finished as soon as
    possible, and is to take into account the style of Christian Latin, the liturgical use of
    psalms, also when sung, and the entire tradition of the Latin Church.</p>
    <p>92. As regards the readings, the following shall be observed: a) Readings from sacred
    scripture shall be arranged so that the riches of God's word may be easily accessible in
    more abundant measure.</p>
    <p>b) Readings excerpted from the works of the fathers, doctors, and ecclesiastical
    writers shall be better selected. </p>
    <p>c) The accounts of martyrdom or the lives of the saints are to accord with the facts of
    history.</p>
    <p>93. To whatever extent may seem desirable, the hymns are to be restored to their
    original form, and whatever smacks of mythology or ill accords with Christian piety is to
    be removed or changed. Also, as occasion may arise, let other selections from the treasury
    of hymns be incorporated.</p>
    <p>94. That the day may be truly sanctified, and that the hours themselves may be recited
    with spiritual advantage, it is best that each of them be prayed at a time which most
    closely corresponds with its true canonical time.</p>
    <p>95. Communities obliged to choral office are bound to celebrate the office in choir
    every day in addition to the conventual Mass. In particular:</p>
    <p>a) Orders of canons, of monks and of nuns, and of other regulars bound by law or
    constitutions to choral office must celebrate the entire office.</p>
    <p>b) Cathedral or collegiate chapters are bound to recite those parts of the office
    imposed on them by general or particular law. </p>
    <p>c) All members of the above communities who are in major orders or who are solemnly
    professed, except for lay brothers, are bound to recite individually those canonical hours
    which they do not pray in choir.</p>
    <p>96. Clerics not bound to office in choir, if they are in major orders, are bound to
    pray the entire office every day, either in common or individually, as laid down in Art.
    89.</p>
    <p>97. Appropriate instances are to be defined by the rubrics in which a liturgical
    service may be substituted for the divine office.</p>
    <p>In particular cases, and for a just reason, ordinaries can dispense their subjects
    wholly or in part from the obligation of reciting the divine office, or may commute the
    obligation.</p>
    <p>98. Members of any institute dedicated to acquiring perfection who, according to their
    constitutions, are to recite any parts of the divine office are thereby performing the
    public prayer of the Church.</p>
    <p>They too perform the public prayer of the Church who, in virtue of their constitutions,
    recite any short office, provided this is drawn up after the pattern of the divine office
    and is duly approved.</p>
    <p>99. Since the divine office is the voice of the Church, that is of the whole mystical
    body publicly praising God, those clerics who are not obliged to office in choir,
    especially priests who live together or who assemble for any purpose, are urged to pray at
    least some part of the divine office in common.</p>
    <p>All who pray the divine office, whether in choir or in common, should fulfill the task
    entrusted to them as perfectly as possible: this refers not only to the internal devotion
    of their minds but also to their external manner of celebration.</p>
    <p>It is, moreover, fitting that the office, both in choir and in common, be sung when
    possible.</p>
    <p>100. Pastors of souls should see to it that the chief hours, especially Vespers, are
    celebrated in common in church on Sundays and the more solemn feasts. And the laity, too,
    are encouraged to recite the divine office, either with the priests, or among themselves,
    or even individually.</p>
    <p>101. 1. In accordance with the centuries-old tradition of the Latin rite, the Latin
    language is to be retained by clerics in the divine office. But in individual cases the
    ordinary has the power of granting the use of a vernacular translation to those clerics
    for whom the use of Latin constitutes a grave obstacle to their praying the office
    properly. The vernacular version, however, must be one that is drawn up according to the
    provision of Art. 36.</p>
    <p>2. The competent superior has the power to grant the use of the vernacular in the
    celebration of the divine office, even in choir, to nuns and to members of institutes
    dedicated to acquiring perfection, both men who are not clerics and women. The version,
    however, must be one that is approved.</p>
    <p>3. Any cleric bound to the divine office fulfills his obligation if he prays the office
    in the vernacular together with a group of the faithful or with those mentioned in 52
    above provided that the text of the translation is approved. </p>
    <p align="center"><b>CHAPTER V </b></p>
    <p align="center"><b>THE LITURGICAL YEAR</b> </p>
    <p>102. Holy Mother Church is conscious that she must celebrate the saving work of her
    divine Spouse by devoutly recalling it on certain days throughout the course of the year.
    Every week, on the day which she has called the Lord's day, she keeps the memory of the
    Lord's resurrection, which she also celebrates once in the year, together with His blessed
    passion, in the most solemn festival of Easter.</p>
    <p>Within the cycle of a year, moreover, she unfolds the whole mystery of Christ, from the
    incarnation and birth until the ascension, the day of Pentecost, and the expectation of
    blessed hope and of the coming of the Lord.</p>
    <p>Recalling thus the mysteries of redemption, the Church opens to the faithful the riches
    of her Lord's powers and merits, so that these are in some way made present for all time,
    and the faithful are enabled to lay hold upon them and become filled with saving grace. </p>
    <p>103. In celebrating this annual cycle of Christ's mysteries, holy Church honors with
    especial love the Blessed Mary, Mother of God, who is joined by an inseparable bond to the
    saving work of her Son. In her the Church holds up and admires the most excellent fruit of
    the redemption, and joyfully contemplates, as in a faultless image, that which she herself
    desires and hopes wholly to be.</p>
    <p>104. The Church has also included in the annual cycle days devoted to the memory of the
    martyrs and the other saints. Raised up to perfection by the manifold grace of God, and
    already in possession of eternal salvation, they sing God's perfect praise in heaven and
    offer prayers for us. By celebrating the passage of these saints from earth to heaven the
    Church proclaims the paschal mystery achieved in the saints who have suffered and been
    glorified with Christ; she proposes them to the faithful as examples drawing all to the
    Father through Christ, and through their merits she pleads for God's favors.</p>
    <p>105. Finally, in the various seasons of the year and according to her traditional
    discipline, the Church completes the formation of the faithful by means of pious practices
    for soul and body, by instruction, prayer, and works of penance and of mercy.</p>
    <p>Accordingly the sacred Council has seen fit to decree as follows.</p>
    <p>106. By a tradition handed down from the apostles which took its origin from the very
    day of Christ's resurrection, the Church celebrates the paschal mystery every eighth day;
    with good reason this, then, bears the name of the Lord's day or Sunday. For on this day
    Christ's faithful are bound to come together into one place so that; by hearing the word
    of God and taking part in the eucharist, they may call to mind the passion, the
    resurrection and the glorification of the Lord Jesus, and may thank God who &quot;has
    begotten them again, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto a living
    hope&quot; (1 Pet. 1:3). Hence the Lord's day is the original feast day, and it should be
    proposed to the piety of the faithful and taught to them so that it may become in fact a
    day of joy and of freedom from work. Other celebrations, unless they be truly of greatest
    importance, shall not have precedence over the Sunday which is the foundation and kernel
    of the whole liturgical year. </p>
    <p>107. The liturgical year is to be revised so that the traditional customs and
    discipline of the sacred seasons shall be preserved or restored to suit the conditions of
    modern times; their specific character is to be retained, so that they duly nourish the
    piety of the faithful who celebrate the mysteries of Christian redemption, and above all
    the paschal mystery. If certain adaptations are considered necessary on account of local
    conditions, they are to be made in accordance with the provisions of Art. 39 and 40.</p>
    <p>108. The minds of the faithful must be directed primarily toward the feasts of the Lord
    whereby the mysteries of salvation are celebrated in the course of the year. Therefore,
    the proper of the time shall be given the preference which is its due over the feasts of
    the saints, so that the entire cycle of the mysteries of salvation may be suitably
    recalled.</p>
    <p>109. The season of Lent has a twofold character: primarily by recalling or preparing
    for baptism and by penance, it disposes the faithful, who more diligently hear the word of
    God and devote themselves to prayer, to celebrate the paschal mystery. This twofold
    character is to be brought into greater prominence both in the liturgy and by liturgical
    catechesis. Hence:</p>
    <p>a) More use is to be made of the baptismal features proper to the Lenten liturgy; some
    of them, which used to flourish in bygone days, are to be restored as may seem good.</p>
    <p>b) The same is to apply to the penitential elements. As regards instruction it is
    important to impress on the minds of the faithful not only a social consequences of sin
    but also that essence of the virtue of penance which leads to the detestation of sin as an
    offence against God; the role of the Church in penitential practices is not to be passed
    over, and the people must be exhorted to pray for sinners.</p>
    <p>110. During Lent penance should not be only internal and individual, but also external
    and social. The practice of penance should be fostered in ways that are possible in our
    own times and in different regions, and according to the circumstances of the faithful; it
    should be encouraged by the authorities mentioned in Art. 22.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, let the paschal fast be kept sacred. Let it be celebrated everywhere on
    Good Friday and, where possible, prolonged throughout Holy Saturday, so that the joys of
    the Sunday of the resurrection may be attained with uplifted and clear mind.</p>
    <p>111. The saints have been traditionally honored in the Church and their authentic
    relics and images held in veneration. For the feasts of the saints proclaim the wonderful
    works of Christ in His servants, and display to the faithful fitting examples for their
    imitation.</p>
    <p>Lest the feasts of the saints should take precedence over the feasts which commemorate
    the very mysteries of salvation, many of them should be left to be celebrated by a
    particular Church or nation or family of religious; only those should be extended to the
    universal Church which commemorate saints who are truly of universal importance. </p>
    <p align="center"><b>CHAPTER</b> </p>
    <p align="center"><b>VI SACRED MUSIC </b></p>
    <p>112. The musical tradition of the universal Church is a treasure of inestimable value,
    greater even than that of any other art. The main reason for this pre-eminence is that, as
    sacred song united to the words, it forms a necessary or integral part of the solemn
    liturgy.</p>
    <p>Holy Scripture, indeed, has bestowed praise upon sacred song (42), and the same may be
    said of the fathers of the Church and of the Roman pontiffs who in recent times, led by
    St. Pius X, have explained more precisely the ministerial function supplied by sacred
    music in the service of the Lord.</p>
    <p>Therefore sacred music is to be considered the more holy in proportion as it is more
    closely connected with the liturgical action, whether it adds delight to prayer, fosters
    unity of minds, or confers greater solemnity upon the sacred rites. But the Church
    approves of all forms of true art having the needed qualities, and admits them into divine
    worship.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, the sacred Council, keeping to the norms and precepts of ecclesiastical
    tradition and discipline, and having regard to the purpose of sacred music, which is the
    glory of God and the sanctification of the faithful, decrees as follows.</p>
    <p>113. Liturgical worship is given a more noble form when the divine offices are
    celebrated solemnly in song, with the assistance of sacred ministers and the active
    participation of the people.</p>
    <p>As regards the language to be used, the provisions of Art. 36 are to be observed; for
    the Mass, Art. 54; for the sacraments, Art. 63; for the divine office. Art. 101.</p>
    <p>114. The treasure of sacred music is to be preserved and fostered with great care.
    Choirs must be diligently promoted, especially in cathedral churches; but bishops and
    other pastors of souls must be at pains to ensure that, whenever the sacred action is to
    be celebrated with song, the whole body of the faithful may be able to contribute that
    active participation which is rightly theirs, as laid down in Art. 28 and 30.</p>
    <p>115. Great importance is to be attached to the teaching and practice of music in
    seminaries, in the novitiates and houses of study of religious of both sexes, and also in
    other Catholic institutions and schools. To impart this instruction, teachers are to be
    carefully trained and put in charge of the teaching of sacred music.</p>
    <p>It is desirable also to found higher institutes of sacred music whenever this can be
    done.</p>
    <p>Composers and singers, especially boys, must also be given a genuine liturgical
    training.</p>
    <p>116. The Church acknowledges Gregorian chant as specially suited to the Roman liturgy:
    therefore, other things being equal, it should be given pride of place in liturgical
    services.</p>
    <p>But other kinds of sacred music, especially polyphony, are by no means excluded from
    liturgical celebrations, so long as they accord with the spirit of the liturgical action,
    as laid down in Art. 30.</p>
    <p>117. The typical edition of the books of Gregorian chant is to be completed; and a more
    critical edition is to be prepared of those books already published since the restoration
    by St. Pius X.</p>
    <p>It is desirable also that an edition be prepared containing simpler melodies, for use
    in small churches.</p>
    <p>118. Religious singing by the people is to be intelligently fostered so that in
    devotions and sacred exercises, as also during liturgical services, the voices of the
    faithful may ring out according to the norms and requirements of the rubrics.</p>
    <p>119. In certain parts of the world, especially mission lands, there are peoples who
    have their own musical traditions, and these play a great part in their religious and
    social life. For this reason due importance is to be attached to their music, and a
    suitable place is to be given to it, not only in forming their attitude toward religion,
    but also in adapting worship to their native genius, as indicated in Art. 39 and 40.</p>
    <p>Therefore, when missionaries are being given training in music, every effort should be
    made to see that they become competent in promoting the traditional music of these
    peoples, both in schools and in sacred services, as far as may be practicable.</p>
    <p>120. In the Latin Church the pipe organ is to be held in high esteem, for it is the
    traditional musical instrument which adds a wonderful splendor to the Church's ceremonies
    and powerfully lifts up man's mind to God and to higher things. </p>
    <p>But other instruments also may be admitted for use in divine worship, with the
    knowledge and consent of the competent territorial authority, as laid down in Art. 22, 52,
    37, and 40. This may be done, however, only on condition that the instruments are
    suitable, or can be made suitable, for sacred use, accord with the dignity of the temple,
    and truly contribute to the edification of the faithful.</p>
    <p>121. Composers, filled with the Christian spirit, should feel that their vocation is to
    cultivate sacred music and increase its store of treasures.</p>
    <p>Let them produce compositions which have the qualities proper to genuine sacred music,
    not confining themselves to works which can be sung only by large choirs, but providing
    also for the needs of small choirs and for the active participation of the entire assembly
    of the faithful.</p>
    <p>The texts intended to be sung must always be in conformity with Catholic doctrine;
    indeed they should be drawn chiefly from holy scripture and from liturgical sources. </p>
    <p align="center"><b>CHAPTER VII</b> </p>
    <p align="center"><b>SACRED ART AND SACRED FURNISHINGS </b></p>
    <p>122. Very rightly the fine arts are considered to rank among the noblest activities of
    man's genius, and this applies especially to religious art and to its highest achievement,
    which is sacred art. These arts, by their very nature, are oriented toward the infinite
    beauty of God which they attempt in some way to portray by the work of human hands; they
    achieve their purpose of redounding to God's praise and glory in proportion as they are
    directed the more exclusively to the single aim of turning men's minds devoutly toward
    God.</p>
    <p>Holy Mother Church has therefore always been the friend of the fine arts and has ever
    sought their noble help, with the special aim that all things set apart for use in divine
    worship should be truly worthy, becoming, and beautiful, signs and symbols of the
    supernatural world, and for this purpose she has trained artists. In fact, the Church has,
    with good reason, always reserved to herself the right to pass judgment upon the arts,
    deciding which of the works of artists are in accordance with faith, piety, and cherished
    traditional laws, and thereby fitted for sacred use.</p>
    <p>The Church has been particularly careful to see that sacred furnishings should worthily
    and beautifully serve the dignity of worship, and has admitted changes in materials,
    style, or ornamentation prompted by the progress of the technical arts with the passage of
    time.</p>
    <p>Wherefore it has pleased the Fathers to issue the following decrees on these matters. </p>
    <p>123. The Church has not adopted any particular style of art as her very own; she has
    admitted styles from every period according to the natural talents and circumstances of
    peoples, and the needs of the various rites. Thus, in the course of the centuries, she has
    brought into being a treasury of art which must be very carefully preserved. The art of
    our own days, coming from every race and region, shall also be given free scope in the
    Church, provided that it adorns the sacred buildings and holy rites with due reverence and
    honor; thereby it is enabled to contribute its own voice to that wonderful chorus of
    praise in honor of the Catholic faith sung by great men in times gone by.</p>
    <p>124. Ordinaries, by the encouragement and favor they show to art which is truly sacred,
    should strive after noble beauty rather than mere sumptuous display. This principle is to
    apply also in the matter of sacred vestments and ornaments.</p>
    <p>Let bishops carefully remove from the house of God and from other sacred places those
    works of artists which are repugnant to faith, morals, and Christian piety, and which
    offend true religious sense either by depraved forms or by lack of artistic worth,
    mediocrity and pretense.</p>
    <p>And when churches are to be built, let great care be taken that they be suitable for
    the celebration of liturgical services and for the active participation of the faithful.</p>
    <p>125. The practice of placing sacred images in churches so that they may be venerated by
    the faithful is to be maintained. Nevertheless their number should be moderate and their
    relative positions should reflect right order. For otherwise they may create confusion
    among the Christian people and foster devotion of doubtful orthodoxy.</p>
    <p>126. When passing judgment on works of art, local ordinaries shall give a hearing to
    the diocesan commission on sacred art and, if needed, also to others who are especially
    expert, and to the commissions referred to in Art. 44, 45, and 46.</p>
    <p>Ordinaries must be very careful to see that sacred furnishings and works of value are
    not disposed of or dispersed; for they are the ornaments of the house of God. </p>
    <p>127. Bishops should have a special concern for artists, so as to imbue them with the
    spirit of sacred art and of the sacred liturgy. This they may do in person or through
    suitable priests who are gifted with a knowledge and love of art.</p>
    <p>It is also desirable that schools or academies of sacred art should be founded in those
    parts of the world where they would be useful, so that artists may be trained.</p>
    <p>All artists who, prompted by their talents, desire to serve God's glory in holy Church,
    should ever bear in mind that they are engaged in a kind of sacred imitation of God the
    Creator, and are concerned with works destined to be used in Catholic worship, to edify
    the faithful, and to foster their piety and their religious formation.</p>
    <p>128. Along with the revision of the liturgical books, as laid down in Art. 25, there is
    to be an early revision of the canons and ecclesiastical statutes which govern the
    provision of material things involved in sacred worship. These laws refer especially to
    the worthy and well planned construction of sacred buildings, the shape and construction
    of altars, the nobility, placing, and safety of the eucharistic tabernacle, the dignity
    and suitability of the baptistery, the proper ordering of sacred images, embellishments,
    and vestments. Laws which seem less suited to the reformed liturgy are to be brought into
    harmony with it, or else abolished; and any which are helpful are to be retained if
    already in use, or introduced where they are lacking.</p>
    <p>According to the norm of Art. 22 of this Constitution, the territorial bodies of
    bishops are empowered to adapt such things to the needs and customs of their different
    regions; this applies especially to the materials and form of sacred furnishings and
    vestments.</p>
    <p>129. During their philosophical and theological studies, clerics are to be taught about
    the history and development of sacred art, and about the sound principles governing the
    production of its works. In consequence they will be able to appreciate and preserve the
    Church's venerable monuments, and be in a position to aid, by good advice, artists who are
    engaged in producing works of art.</p>
    <p>130. It is fitting that the use of pontificals be reserved to those ecclesiastical
    persons who have episcopal rank or some particular jurisdiction. </p>

    <p align="center"><b>APPENDIX </b></p>
    <p align="center"><b><i><font SIZE="+1">A DECLARATION OF THE SECOND ECUMENICAL COUNCIL OF
    THE VATICAN ON REVISION OF THE CALENDAR </font></i></b></p>
    <p>The Second Ecumenical Sacred Council of the Vatican, recognizing the importance of the
    wishes expressed by many concerning the assignment of the feast of Easter to a fixed
    Sunday and concerning an unchanging calendar, having carefully considered the effects
    which could result from the introduction of a new calendar, declares as follows:<ol>
      <li>The Sacred Council would not object if the feast of Easter were assigned to a particular
        Sunday of the Gregorian Calendar, provided that those whom it may concern, especially the
        brethren who are not in communion with the Apostolic See, give their assent. </li>
      <li>The Sacred Council likewise declares that it does not oppose efforts designed to
        introduce a perpetual calendar into civil society. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>But among the various systems which are being suggested to stabilize a perpetual
    calendar and to introduce it into civil life, the Church has no objection only in the case
    of those systems which retain and safeguard a seven-day week with Sunday, without the
    introduction of any days outside the week, so that the succession of weeks may be left
    intact, unless there is question of the most serious reasons. Concerning these the
    Apostolic See shall judge. </p>
