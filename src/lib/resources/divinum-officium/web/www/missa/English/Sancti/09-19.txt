O God, Who gladden us by the annual festival of Your Martyrs Januarius and~
Companions, grant that we may be inspired by the example of those in whose~
merits we rejoice.

[Evangelium]
Continuation + of the Holy Gospel according to Matthew
!Matt 24:3-13
At that time, as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to~
Him privately, saying, Tell us, when are these things to happen, and what will~
be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the world? And in answer Jesus said~
to them, Take care that no one leads you astray. For many will come in My name,~
saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. For you shall hear~
of wars and rumors of wars. Take care that you do not be alarmed, for these~
things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against~
nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be pestilences and famines~
and earthquakes in various places. But all these things are the beginnings of~
sorrows. Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and will put you to death;~
and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake. And then many will fall~
away, and will betray one another, and will hate one another. And many false~
prophets will arise, and will lead many astray. And because iniquity will abound,~
the charity of the many will grow cold. But whoever perseveres to the end, he~
shall be saved.
