[Oratio]
O God, Who crowned blessed King Edward with the glory of eternity, grant us, we~
beseech You, so to venerate him on earth that we may be worthy to reign with him~
in heaven.

[Secreta]
We offer You sacrifices of praise, O Lord, in memory of Your Saints; trusting~
that by them we may be delivered from both present and future evils.
$Per Dominum

[Postcommunio]
Refreshed with heavenly food and drink, we humbly pray You, our God, that we~
also may be helped by his prayers in memory of whom we have partaken.
