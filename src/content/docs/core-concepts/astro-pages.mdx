**Pages** are files that live in the `src/pages/` subdirectory of your Astro project. They are responsible for handling routing, data loading, and overall page layout for every page in your website.

## Supported page files 

Astro supports the following file types in the `src/pages/` directory:
- [`.astro`](#astro-pages)
- [`.md`](#markdownmdx-pages)
- `.mdx` (with the [MDX Integration installed](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#installation))
- [`.html`](#html-pages)
- `.js`/`.ts` (as [endpoints](/en/core-concepts/endpoints/))

## File-based routing

Astro leverages a routing strategy called **file-based routing**. Each file in your `src/pages/` directory becomes an endpoint on your site based on its file path.

A single file can also generate multiple pages using [dynamic routing](/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes). This allows you to create pages even if your content lives outside of the special `/pages/` directory, such as in a [content collection](/en/guides/content-collections/) or a [CMS](/en/guides/cms/).

### Link between pages

Write standard HTML [`<a>` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) in your Astro pages to link to other pages on your site.

## Astro Pages

Astro pages use the `.astro` file extension and support the same features as [Astro components](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/).

```astro
---
// Example: src/pages/index.astro
---
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My Homepage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

To avoid repeating the same HTML elements on every page, you can move common `<head>` and `<body>` elements into your own [layout components](/en/core-concepts/layouts/). You can use as many or as few layout components as you'd like.

```astro {3} /</?MySiteLayout>/
---
// Example: src/pages/index.astro
import MySiteLayout from '../layouts/MySiteLayout.astro';
---
<MySiteLayout>
  <p>My page content, wrapped in a layout!</p>
</MySiteLayout>
```

## Markdown/MDX Pages

Astro also treats any Markdown (`.md`) files inside of `src/pages/` as pages in your final website. If you have the [MDX Integration installed](/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#installation), it also treats MDX (`.mdx`) files the same way. These are commonly used for text-heavy pages like blog posts and documentation.

[Collections of Markdown or MDX page content](/en/guides/content-collections/) in `src/content/` can be used to [generate pages dynamically](/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes).

Page layouts are especially useful for [Markdown files](#markdownmdx-pages). Markdown files can use the special `layout` front matter property to specify a [layout component](/en/core-concepts/layouts/) that will wrap their Markdown content in a full `<html>...</html>` page document.

```md {3}
---
# Example: src/pages/page.md
layout: '../layouts/MySiteLayout.astro'
title: 'My Markdown page'
---
# Title

This is my page, written in **Markdown.**
```

## HTML Pages

Files with the `.html` file extension can be placed in the `src/pages/` and used directly as pages on your site. Note that some key Astro features are not supported in [HTML Components](/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#html-components).

## Custom 404 Error Page

For a custom 404 error page, you can create a `404.astro` or `404.md` file in `/src/pages`.

This will build to a `404.html` page. Most [deploy services](/en/guides/deploy/) will find and use it.
